      <title>The Veteran Candidate</title>
      <description>Seth Moulton, the Massachusetts congressman and presidential candidate, joins Isaac Dovere this week. Moulton shares his thoughts on Nancy Pelosi, ‘the squad,’ and the direction of the Democratic Party. Speaking soon after Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s hearings on Capitol Hill, Moulton gives his reaction as an early proponent of impeachment. And the decorated Marine veteran discusses his campaign’s focus on national security issues and why the current commander-in-chief is “putting American lives at risk.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>How to Cover Racist Tweets</title>
      <description>On Sunday, President Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/trumps-white-nationalist-attack-four-congresswomen/594019/"&gt;told four members of Congress&lt;/a&gt; to “go back” to the countries “from which they came.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Journalists have spent the week working through how to discuss what is a &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eeoc-go-back-where-you-came-from-discrimination-federal-law-trump-tweets/"&gt;textbook racist statement&lt;/a&gt; aimed at four congresswomen who—besides all being American citizens—are all women of color.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Newsrooms faced hard questions: Do you call the president a racist? How do you not call the president a racist? Do you give him the attention he wants, and how do you modulate that, contextualize it, explain it? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Margaret Brennan, moderator of CBS’s &lt;em&gt;Face the Nation&lt;/em&gt;, joins Isaac Dovere on this week’s Radio Atlantic to discuss how journalists are faring with these questions and what we can expect going into 2020.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Trump Diplomacy</title>
      <description>This week, the British ambassador to the United States &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/trumps-bullying-forces-uk-ambassador-resign/593668/"&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt; after private cables leaked with his frank assessment of the White House and its occupant. Sir Kim Darroch described the administration as “clumsy” and "inept" and said President Trump "radiates insecurity." In response, the president called Darroch “wacky,” a “very stupid guy,” and a “pompous fool.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The episode is another in a long string of public feuds for Trump. But the departure of the ambassador from America's closest ally is no small matter—and one that ripples far outside Washington. So, what consequences could this have for the country and the world? And how do diplomats deal with this president when, as a current ambassador &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/world/europe/kim-darroch-trump.html"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, "it could have been any one of us?"&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To discuss, Isaac Dovere is joined by Thomas Pickering, a Career Ambassador for the United States whose seven ambassadorships span decades of Republican and Democratic administrations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>The Other Republican</title>
      <description>Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld has experience taking down a Republican president. He began his career in politics as one of the first lawyers hired to investigate Watergate for the House.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working alongside another low-level staffer named Hillary Clinton, his job was to define what constituted an impeachable offense for a president. Now, he’s one of the rare Republicans who thinks Donald Trump’s actions have met that definition. He’s called for the president to be impeached, and even to resign his office.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He joined Isaac Dovere on this week’s Radio Atlantic to discuss his time investigating Watergate, the state of the Republican Party, and why he thinks his candidacy isn’t such a longshot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>The Fight for Reparations</title>
      <description>On Wednesday—for the first time in a decade—Congress held a hearing on reparations for slavery. It was a crystallizing moment for an issue that has gained prominence since Ta-Nehisi Coates’s &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/"&gt;2014 Atlantic essay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coates and others testified before a House committee on June 19th—Juneteenth—a day the nation celebrates emancipation from slavery. Every year, Atlantic staff writer Vann R. Newkirk II writes a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/juneteenth-and-reparations-hearing-house/592036/"&gt;Juneteenth essay&lt;/a&gt;. He joins Isaac Dovere to discuss the history of the holiday, the importance of the hearing, and where the fight for reparations stands now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Partisanship at the Supreme Court</title>
      <description>In the coming days, the Supreme Court will announce its decisions on two cases that ask the same basic question: how far should partisan politics go?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One will determine whether a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/census-case-about-white-mans-government/590977/"&gt;citizenship question&lt;/a&gt; will appear on the 2020 census. The other asks whether &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/01/supreme-court-will-rule-gerrymandering-md-and-nc/579550/"&gt;partisan gerrymandering&lt;/a&gt; is constitutional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With these decisions imminent, that same question about partisanship in non-partisan institutions hangs over the court itself. Still &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/09/republicans-schedules-votes-kavanaugh-nomination/571591/"&gt;wounded&lt;/a&gt; by Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation battle, the nation’s highest court has a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/10/kavanaughs-partisanship-threatens-supreme-court/571702/"&gt;“virus of illegitimacy.”&lt;/a&gt; And with Democratic candidates &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/buttigiegs-supreme-court-plan-and-democratic-party/590905/"&gt;endorsing&lt;/a&gt; proposals to pack the court, that virus could remake the third branch of American government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On this week’s Radio Atlantic, Isaac Dovere discusses the court with lawyer and &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; writer Mark Joseph Stern.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>The Abortion Debate’s New Urgency</title>
      <description>Recent weeks have seen unprecedented anti-abortion bills pass in states across the country. In Alabama, abortion is now &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/05/17/havent-been-following-abortion-ban-news-heres-everything-you-need-know/?utm_term=.15c9ac7b4943"&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt; under state law, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Georgia, Ohio, and Kentucky have all passed so-called &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/588958/heartbeat-bill/"&gt;‘heartbeat’ bills&lt;/a&gt; making abortion illegal six to eight weeks into pregnancy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Wednesday, Louisiana's legislature &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/us/louisiana-abortion-heartbeat-bill.html"&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt; its own heartbeat bill without any exceptions for rape or incest. In Missouri, abortion has been &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/24/724532856/missouri-governor-signs-ban-on-abortion-after-8-weeks-of-pregnancy"&gt;outlawed&lt;/a&gt; after eight weeks.

Wade&lt;/em&gt;, but of course, that conflict is &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/05/alabama-georgia-abortion-bills/589504/"&gt;the point&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Trump’s Trade War</title>
      <description>Trump isn’t like most Republican presidents, but his views on trade have been an unusually firm departure from his party. Despite long championing free trade, the GOP is now led by a man who seems deeply skeptical of it. Last week, he upended trade negotiations with China by levying tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods, carrying out&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/05/trump-says-tariffs-on-200-billion-of-chinese-goods-will-increase-to-25percent-on-friday.html"&gt;&amp;nbsp;a threat he’d issued&lt;/a&gt; just before a Chinese delegation visited the White House. On Monday, China&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/05/13/trump-warns-china-not-retaliate-tariffs-insists-they-wont-hurt-us-consumers/?utm_term=.c3bc7d50529c"&gt; retaliated&lt;/a&gt; with tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. goods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A trade war between the world’s two largest economies &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-china-trade-war-tariffs-negotiations-public-8ea9cc5a-a6ec-4e77-9caf-f3e2251edccd.html"&gt;seems to be here&lt;/a&gt;. And the risks are dire. Financial institutions have &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-trade-war-china-tariffs-global-recession-13934f3b-14a5-4e0e-b710-25a6d3ff428b.html"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that "a trade war could cause a global recession," but, as the president infamously &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/02/trump-trade-wars-are-good-and-easy-to-win.html"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; last year, he thinks “trade wars are good, and easy to win.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On this week’s Radio Atlantic, staff writer Isaac Dovere sits down with Colin Grabow, a trade expert from the libertarian Cato Institute, to discuss the two trade battles at hand: one between the U.S. and China, and the other within the Republican party.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

Orbán &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/peterbakernyt/status/1125753841029459968"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; his vision of Hungary as an "alternative to &lt;a href="https://theweek.com/articles/820922/europes-coming-antiliberal-empire"&gt;liberal democracy&lt;/a&gt;," and, in recent years, cemented his power by undermining civil society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Orbán’s party &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/13/17823488/hungary-democracy-authoritarianism-trump"&gt;won a majority last year&lt;/a&gt;, it rewrote parts of the constitution, redrew parliamentary districts, and stacked courts. Foer details how one of the last independent institutions—a university in Budapest founded by George Soros—has fought back on Orbán’s efforts to expel it from Hungary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These efforts have not been met with condemnation from the Trump administration. To the contrary, when he spoke with Foer, the U.S. Ambassador to Hungary &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FranklinFoer/status/1126476854397943808"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: "I can tell you, knowing the president for a good 25 or 30 years, that he would love to have the situation that Viktor Orbán has."&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Next week, President Trump will &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-hungary/trump-will-host-hungarys-orban-at-white-house-white-house-idUSKCN1SD1KX"&gt;welcome&lt;/a&gt; Orbán to the White House.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How has Hungary found itself losing its democracy?

      <title>The Trauma at the Border</title>
      <description>On Tuesday, Attorney General William Barr &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/17/714381003/ag-barr-orders-immigration-judges-to-stop-releasing-asylum-seekers-out-on-bail"&gt;ordered&lt;/a&gt; immigration judges to stop releasing asylum seekers on bail. The move signals an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/us/politics/trump-asylum-seekers-federal-judge.html"&gt;even fiercer immigration policy&lt;/a&gt; that could include the return of family separations.

      <title>Can A Long-Shot Candidate Beat Donald Trump?</title>
      <description>The crowded race for the Democratic nomination includes both frontrunners and long-shots, but how do we know which is which? Some big names have trailed in fundraising and polls. And some written off early have found surprising support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On this week’s Radio Atlantic, Isaac Dovere is joined by one of the biggest long-shot successes in recent Democratic politics: Howard Dean. The former Vermont governor was an unlikely frontrunner for the presidency, but for a time in the 2004 race, he was the man to beat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dean talks about what it was like to go from long-shot to frontrunner—and what it’s like to have it all fall apart. He recalls how his 2004 campaign was animated (and perhaps limited) by anger at President Bush. Now, Dean warns Democrats against falling into the same trap with Donald Trump.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Sex, Gender, and the Democratic Party</title>
      <description>In recent days, three women have accused former Vice President Joe Biden of inappropriate contact. On Wednesday, Biden announced in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1113515882960052224"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; that he is going to be “mindful” about personal space going forward, that he hears what these women are saying, and that he "gets it."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While a number of prominent women have come to Biden's defense, there are plenty of critics who have said he has no place representing a diverse, empowered, progressive electorate in the coming presidential race. When it comes to gender, have the politics of the Democratic party &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/joe-biden-encino-man/586378/"&gt;passed Joe Biden by&lt;/a&gt;?

And what does it mean for the Democratic party of 2020?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex Wagner sits down with Jennifer Palmieri, former Communications Director for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and for the Obama White House from 2013 to 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Politics After Mueller</title>
      <description>Last week, the special counsel submitted his report to Attorney General Bill Barr. And this week, Barr shared his brief summary of the big conclusions: there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. As for obstruction of justice, Mueller left that question unresolved. In his letter, Barr said the DOJ had decided the evidence presented didn’t merit criminal charges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More could change with the release of the actual report. In fact, six House committee chairs have &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/25/dems-mueller-report-1235373"&gt;demanded&lt;/a&gt; it by next Tuesday. But the Mueller chapter of this presidency is now essentially closed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What does the post-Mueller landscape look like? Does the end of his investigation — with no bombshells detonated as yet — hurt Democrats in 2020? Or might it actually help them?

      <title>President Trump’s Post-Mueller Corruption Problem</title>
      <description>When elected, most presidents either sell their assets or put them in a blind trust. Isolating a president’s financial interests from their time in office has been a norm for decades: from Jimmy Carter giving up his peanut farm to Barack Obama liquidating his assets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Donald Trump is not like most presidents. He’s said he &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-finance/trump-says-wont-divest-from-his-business-while-president-idUSKBN14V21I"&gt;won’t&lt;/a&gt; divest from his businesses, even though his real estate deals around the world open up countless opportunities for conflicts of interest. His unprecedented decision may violate the “emoluments clause” of the Constitution — a rule that’s existed longer than the American republic, but has never before faced scrutiny in the courts. On Tuesday, a panel of Fourth Circuit judges heard an emoluments case and their decision appears &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/19/trump-emoluments-lawsuit-1226687"&gt;likely&lt;/a&gt; to send the fight to Supreme Court.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex Wagner talks to Joshua Matz, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in that case, a Georgetown law professor, and co-author of the January 2017 &lt;em&gt;Atlantic &lt;/em&gt;story: &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/trumps-ethics-train-wreck/513446/"&gt;”Why Trump Will Violate the Foreign Emoluments Clause”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Paul Manafort and the Problem of White-Collar Crime</title>
      <description>Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort will spend around seven years in federal prison — far less than the nineteen to twenty-four years recommended by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The sentences prompted a backlash when a federal judge in Virginia said Manafort deserved leniency for his &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/03/paul-manaforts-otherwise-blamess-life-crime/584419/"&gt;“otherwise blameless life.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it’s not just the punishment that has people talking. Manafort’s crimes only came to light after the &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/why-manafort-and-cohen-thought-theyd-get-away-with-it"&gt;unlikely&lt;/a&gt; events that led to the Mueller investigation. Manafort’s own lawyer &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/manaforts-lawyers-appealed-for-mercy--but-not-from-the-judge/2019/03/13/29bb3872-45cc-11e9-8aab-95b8d80a1e4f_story.html?utm_term=.d64926955c83"&gt;said as much&lt;/a&gt; this week: “but for” the 2016 election, his client wouldn’t have been in court. The episode has renewed questions that have been asked — if not answered — since the the 2008 financial crisis: Why are white-collar criminals so rarely prosecuted? And when they are, why do they seem to get off with lighter punishment?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex Wagner puts those questions to attorney and former federal prosecutor Ken White. White is the person behind &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Popehat"&gt;@popehat on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and the author of the recent &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; article: &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/03/what-manafort-sentence-reveals/584452/"&gt;“6 Reasons Paul Manafort Got Off So Lightly.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>The Future of the Democratic Party</title>
      <description>The Democratic party is in a battle with itself. After devastating losses in 2016, the party was resurgent in 2018, but the lessons from both elections remain unclear: should the Democratic party be one of progressive grassroots activism or should it try to win back suburban and moderate voters?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dan Pfeiffer — former senior advisor to President Obama and co-host of &lt;em&gt;Pod Save America&lt;/em&gt; — thinks the choice is a false one.

      <title>State of Emergency</title>
      <description>Last week, President Trump declared a national emergency to get funding for the wall. The move gave him elevated power to move money around, but it was immediately met with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/us/politics/national-emergency-lawsuits-trump.html"&gt;lawsuits from 16 states&lt;/a&gt;.

And just how far do a president’s emergency powers really go?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex Wagner speaks with Liza Goitein, Co-Director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center. Months before the president’s announcement, Goitein looked into what powers presidents have in a national emergency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/presidential-emergency-powers/576418/"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about her &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/press-release/president-has-extraordinary-authority-under-emergency-declarations-have-gone-unchecked"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; magazine, describing over 100 emergency powers she said were “ripe for abuse” and that “this edifice of extraordinary powers has historically rested on the assumption that the president will act in the country’s best interest when using them.”&amp;nbsp; What could happen in the hands of a president less concerned with norms?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Is the President a Russian Asset?</title>
      <description>On Friday, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; published a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/us/politics/fbi-trump-russia-inquiry.html"&gt;startling story&lt;/a&gt;: In 2017, days after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, the bureau opened an inquiry into whether the president was secretly working on behalf of Russia. It was an explosive development in an already major story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since this news came out, it’s informed how we see two other very big new stories: On Sunday, the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-has-concealed-details-of-his-face-to-face-encounters-with-putin-from-senior-officials-in-administration/2019/01/12/65f6686c-1434-11e9-b6ad-9cfd62dbb0a8_story.html?utm_term=.e950bb603ee3"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Trump has gone to “extraordinary lengths” to conceal details of his conversations with Vladimir Putin.

In fact, it took more than a half century to reach the point where faced with a choice between democracy and power, the party chose the latter.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To understand how the party of Lincoln became the party of Trump, Alex Wagner spoke with Packer on this week’s episode of Radio Atlantic.

Afterwards, moderate Republicans became &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/12/the-demise-of-the-moderate-republican"&gt;an endangered species&lt;/a&gt;, the Tea Party emerged as a major force, and Trump’s brand of corrosive politics became, Packer says, “inevitable.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Does the NRA Connect Trump to Russia?</title>
      <description>On Thursday, Maria Butina became the first Russian national &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/12/maria-butina-pleads-guilty-russian-agent/578146/"&gt;convicted&lt;/a&gt; of seeking to influence the 2016 election. As part of Russia’s years-long effort to cozy up &lt;a href="http://time.com/4696424/moscow-right-kremlin-republicans/"&gt;to the American right&lt;/a&gt;, Butina gained access to conservative circles through the National Rifle Association. And as the NRA is under scrutiny for &lt;a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2018/12/nra-ties-to-russians-draw-scrutiny/"&gt;ties to Russian operatives&lt;/a&gt;, it appears the organization &lt;a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2018/12/trump-nra-campaign-coordination/"&gt;illegally coordinated&lt;/a&gt; with the Trump campaign.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex Wagner catches up on the week’s developments with Atlantic staff writer Natasha Bertrand.

      <title>Florida Flashbacks</title>
      <description>The midterms were over a week ago, but a number of races have yet to be called. In Florida, the senate and governor elections have both come down to a recount, and accusations of vote-tampering are flying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex Wagner talks with Atlantic staff writer Isaac Dovere to understand what’s going on, and then turns to two veterans of the last such debacle: Mark McKinnon, chief media adviser for George W.

The move backfired. A DNA result does not confer a Cherokee heritage. And in general, efforts to link our genetics with our ethnic or cultural identities have a long and sordid history.

      <itunes:summary>
        <![CDATA[Senator Elizabeth Warren recently shared results of a genetic analysis to back up her family’s story of Cherokee ancestry, hoping to blunt a favorite Republican attack line. The move backfired. A DNA result does not confer a Cherokee heritage. And in general, efforts to link our genetics with our ethnic or cultural identities have a long and sordid history. So what’s more revealing: the results of DNA tests like Warren’s?

      <title>The Endless Devastation of Hurricane Season</title>
      <description>This week, the most rigorous estimate yet of deaths caused by Hurricane Maria was published, marking a grim milestone: the hurricane season of 2017 was one of the deadliest in North America in a century.

Because of climate change, these types of extreme disasters may only grow more common.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this episode, &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;’s staff writers Vann Newkirk and Elaina Plott join Matt Thompson to discuss their reporting on Puerto Rico and Houston.

      <title>When Does Hollywood’s Diversity Become Real Representation?</title>
      <description>With movies like &lt;em&gt;Crazy Rich Asians, BlacKkKlansman&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Sorry To Bother You &lt;/em&gt;out in theaters, Hollywood is trying to mute the complaint that it lacks racial and ethnic diversity, to avoid another #OscarsSoWhite.

      <title>The Future of Europe</title>
      <description>As President Trump meets with other western leaders in Europe, the spirit of democratic cooperation we’re used to in NATO summits is gone. But it’s not just Trump.

      <title>The North Korea Summit</title>
      <description>Two of the world’s most volatile heads of state—Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump—have moved in the span of a year from trading insults to trading fawning letters. Now, they're days away from the first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader. Between Kim's nuclear ambitions and Trump's political pressures, the stakes of this exchange couldn’t be higher. Are we headed toward the world’s most unlikely match?

      <title>Is Politics Ruining Pop Culture?</title>
      <description>Some Americans who grew up identifying with &lt;em&gt;Roseanne&lt;/em&gt; have found themselves alienated by Roseanne Barr’s outspoken devotion to President Trump.

      <title>Becoming White in America</title>
      <description>In her new book &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/248653/futureface-by-alex-wagner/9780812997941/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Futureface&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Alex Wagner writes that “immigration raises into relief some of our most basic existential questions: Who am I? Where do I belong? And in that way, it’s inextricably tied to an exploration of American identity.” In the book, Alex explores her own American identity – daughter of a Burmese immigrant mother and a small-town Irish Catholic father – and asks how true the stories we grow up with really are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along with co-hosts Matt and Jeff, Alex is joined by &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;’s deputy politics editor Adam Serwer to discuss the tangled intersections of history, heritage, family, race, and nationality. Is America truly a melting pot? Can nationalism be liberal?

      <title>News Update: Who Could Tame Facebook?</title>
      <description>As &lt;em&gt;Atlantic &lt;/em&gt;staff writer Robinson Meyer &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/04/mark-zuckerberg-atlantic-exclusive/557489/"&gt;recently wrote&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook “is currently embroiled in the worst crisis of trust in its 14-year history.” This week, the company’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before the U.S. Congress for the first time. It’s not clear whether Congress will seek to exert more regulatory control over the company, even after revelations that as many as 87 million people unwittingly had their Facebook data given to the political firm Cambridge Analytica, which may have used some of that data to influence the 2016 U.S. election. And the questions senators asked of Zuckerberg suggest &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/04/mark-zuckerberg-power-broker/557711/"&gt;they may not yet understand Facebook well enough&lt;/a&gt; to regulate it effectively, even if they wanted to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this &lt;em&gt;Radio Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; news update, Rob shares what he learned from his &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/04/mark-zuckerberg-atlantic-exclusive/557489/"&gt;exclusive interview with Zuckerberg&lt;/a&gt;, and from the CEO’s testimony before Congress.

      <title>King Remembered</title>
      <description>In his last speech, known to history as “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop,” Martin Luther King Jr. began by remarking on the introduction he’d been given by his friend, Ralph Abernathy. “As I listened to ... his eloquent and generous introduction and then thought about myself,” King said modestly, “I wondered who he was talking about.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The facsimile of King that America would fashion after his assassination—saintly pacifist, stranger to controversy, beloved by all—might have provoked something well beyond wonder. To create a version of King that America could love, the nation sanded down the reality of the man, his ministry, and his activism.

      <title>If We Could Learn From History</title>
      <description>Discarding the limits on a leader's time in office is a classic autocrat's move.

      <title>How Innocence Becomes Irrelevant (No Way Out, Part III)</title>
      <description>After Rick Magnis, a Texas judge, reviewed the evidence in Benjamine Spencer’s case, he recommended a new trial for Spencer “on the grounds of actual innocence.” But Texas’s highest criminal court took the rare step of rejecting the judge’s ruling. Why? Because Spencer did not meet the state’s “Herculean” standard of unassailable proof, such as DNA, that would remove all doubts of his innocence. According to the judge who wrote the opinion denying Spencer a new trial, this standard has kept innocent people in prison without a possibility of getting out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this third and final chapter of “No Way Out,” we reveal more evidence that points to Spencer’s innocence: A new witness who confirms his alibi, new technology that calls into question the testimony of the star eyewitness in his trial, and a full recantation by another key eyewitness against him. We also share a stunning discovery: potential DNA evidence that offers Spencer the thinnest hope of meeting the state’s astronomical burden of proof.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet, none of this may be enough to exonerate Benjamine Spencer. In this episode, we explore why that is, and what it means.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/1857/11/radio-atlantic-how-innocence-becomes-irrelevant/554021/"&gt;A list of key individuals mentioned in this story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/01/no-way-out/546575/"&gt;"Can You Prove Your Innocence Without DNA?"&lt;/a&gt; (Barbara Bradley Hagerty, January/February 2018 issue)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/innocence-is-irrelevant/534171/"&gt;"Innocence Is Irrelevant"&lt;/a&gt; (Emily Yoffe, September 2017 issue)&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <description>In part one of our three-part series &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/no-way-out/"&gt;"No Way Out,"&lt;/a&gt; Barbara Bradley Hagerty told the story of how Benjamine Spencer was convicted for the murder of Jeffrey Young, and how much of the evidence that led to that conviction has fallen apart under scrutiny. But if Spencer did not kill him, who else could have? And if the evidence does point to another assailant, is that enough to free Spencer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this episode, part two of three, Barbara explores an alternate theory of the crime. She talks with two friends of another man they say boasted about committing it. Their story, coupled with the shoddiness of the evidence that convicted Spencer, was enough to secure a recommendation that Spencer be given a new trial, "on the grounds of actual innocence."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key individuals mentioned in this story&lt;/strong&gt; (listed in order of appearance):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Part I:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benjamine Spencer&lt;/strong&gt;, the prisoner, convicted in October 1987, retried and convicted in March 1988, given life in prison&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeffrey Young&lt;/strong&gt;, the victim, murdered in Dallas in March 1987&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jay Young&lt;/strong&gt;, Jeffrey’s son, the elder of two&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheryl Wattley&lt;/strong&gt;, Spencer’s current attorney&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troy Johnson&lt;/strong&gt;, a friend of Jeffrey Young’s, who tried calling him the night of his murder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harry Young&lt;/strong&gt;, Jeffrey’s father, a senior executive in Ross Perot’s company&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus “Jessie” Briseno&lt;/strong&gt;, a detective for the Dallas Police Department, the lead investigator on the murder of Jeffrey Young&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gladys Oliver&lt;/strong&gt;, the prosecution’s star eyewitness in the trials of Benjamine Spencer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Mitchell&lt;/strong&gt;, another man convicted a week after Spencer in a separate trial for the same crime, now deceased&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith Johnson&lt;/strong&gt;, the current district attorney in Dallas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frank Jackson&lt;/strong&gt;, Spencer’s defense attorney in the original trial&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andy Beach&lt;/strong&gt;, the prosecutor in the trial that sent Spencer to prison&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alan Ledbetter&lt;/strong&gt;, the foreman of the jury that convicted Spencer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Edwards&lt;/strong&gt;, the jailhouse informant who testified in Spencer’s original trials that Spencer had confessed to him&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debra Spencer&lt;/strong&gt;, Benjamine Spencer’s wife at the time of his conviction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christi Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, the alibi witness who testified in Spencer’s defense at his trials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim McCloskey&lt;/strong&gt;, the founder of Centurion Ministries, the group that has aided Spencer's quest for exoneration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daryl Parker&lt;/strong&gt;, a private investigator who has helped re-examine Spencer’s case and Young’s murder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmie Cotton&lt;/strong&gt;, one of three eyewitnesses for the prosecution in Spencer’s original trials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Stewart&lt;/strong&gt;, another of three eyewitnesses for the prosecution in Spencer’s trials, now deceased&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandra Brackens&lt;/strong&gt;, a potential witness in Spencer’s defense who was not called to testify at his trials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New to Part II:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Hubbard&lt;/strong&gt;, an alternative suspect in Young's death&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ferrell Scott&lt;/strong&gt;, a childhood friend of Hubbard's&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kelvin Johnson&lt;/strong&gt;, a friend of Hubbard's who claims to have committed robberies with him&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craig Watkins&lt;/strong&gt;, a newly-elected District Attorney interested in reinvestigating claims of innocence&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge Rick Magnis&lt;/strong&gt;, the judge of Texas' 283rd District&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/radio-atlantic/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe to Radio Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to hear part three in the “No Way Out” series when it's released.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>No Way Out, Part I</title>
      <description>In 1987, Jeffrey Young was robbed and killed, and his body was left on a street in the poor neighborhood of West Dallas. Benjamine Spencer was tried and convicted for the attack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spencer was black, 22 years old, and recently married. Young was 33 and white, and his father was a senior executive for Ross Perot, one of the most prominent businessmen in Dallas. No physical evidence connected Spencer to the murder. Instead, he was convicted based on the testimony of three eyewitnesses and a jailhouse informant who claimed Spencer confessed to the crime. Spencer has now been in prison for most of his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From behind bars, Spencer amassed evidence to support his claim of innocence, and secured the assistance of Centurion Ministries, a group that re-examines cases of prisoners like him. Together, they were able to convince a Texas judge of Spencer’s innocence. In investigating this story, not only did we confirm Centurion’s findings, but we’ve gathered new, exculpatory evidence, some of which appears first in this special, three-episode series of &lt;em&gt;Radio Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key individuals mentioned in this story&lt;/strong&gt; (listed in order of appearance):&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benjamine Spencer&lt;/strong&gt;, the prisoner, convicted in October 1987, retried and convicted in March 1988, given life in prison&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeffrey Young&lt;/strong&gt;, the victim, murdered in Dallas in March 1987&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jay Young&lt;/strong&gt;, Jeffrey’s son, the elder of two&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheryl Wattley&lt;/strong&gt;, Spencer’s current attorney&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troy Johnson&lt;/strong&gt;, a friend of Jeffrey Young’s, who tried calling him the night of his murder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harry Young&lt;/strong&gt;, Jeffrey’s father, a senior executive in Ross Perot’s company&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus “Jessie” Briseno&lt;/strong&gt;, a detective for the Dallas Police Department, the lead investigator on the murder of Jeffrey Young&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gladys Oliver&lt;/strong&gt;, the prosecution’s star eyewitness in the trials of Benjamine Spencer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Mitchell&lt;/strong&gt;, another man convicted a week after Spencer in a separate trial for the same crime, now deceased&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith Johnson&lt;/strong&gt;, the current district attorney in Dallas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frank Jackson&lt;/strong&gt;, Spencer’s defense attorney in the original trial&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andy Beach&lt;/strong&gt;, the prosecutor in the trial that sent Spencer to prison&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alan Ledbetter&lt;/strong&gt;, the foreman of the jury that convicted Spencer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Edwards&lt;/strong&gt;, the jailhouse informant who testified in Spencer’s original trials that Spencer had confessed to him&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debra Spencer&lt;/strong&gt;, Benjamine Spencer’s wife at the time of his conviction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christi Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, the alibi witness who testified in Spencer’s defense at his trials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim McCloskey&lt;/strong&gt;, the founder of Centurion Ministries, the group that has aided Spencer's quest for exoneration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daryl Parker&lt;/strong&gt;, a private investigator who has helped re-examine Spencer’s case and Young’s murder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmie Cotton&lt;/strong&gt;, one of three eyewitnesses for the prosecution in Spencer’s original trials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Stewart&lt;/strong&gt;, another of three eyewitnesses for the prosecution in Spencer’s trials, now deceased&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sandra Brackens&lt;/strong&gt;, a potential witness in Spencer’s defense who was not called to testify at his trials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/radio-atlantic/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe to Radio Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to hear part two in the “No Way Out” series when it's released.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Paul Manafort and How the Swamp Was Made</title>
      <description>“Conventional wisdom suggests that the temptations of Washington, D.C., corrupt all the idealists, naïfs, and ingenues who settle there," &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/03/paul-manafort-american-hustler/550925/"&gt;Franklin Foer writes&lt;/a&gt; in his cover story for the March issue of &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic.&lt;/em&gt; "But what if that formulation gets the causation backwards?

Foer tells the story of Manafort's rise and fall, his stint as a consigliere to oligarchs, and the lines he was willing to cross in lobbying and political consulting.

      <title>The Presidential Fitness Challenge</title>
      <description>As the anniversary of his inauguration nears, a new book filled with salacious claims about the Trump administration has become a bestseller. Faced with renewed questions about his mental and temperamental fitness for the office, President Trump has pushed back, declaring himself a “very stable genius” and attacking his critics. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But no new claims or revelations, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/it-was-an-open-secret/549653/"&gt;James Fallows wrote recently for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, have been more telling than Trump's public behavior.

        <![CDATA[As the anniversary of his inauguration nears, a new book filled with salacious claims about the Trump administration has become a bestseller. Faced with renewed questions about his mental and temperamental fitness for the office, President Trump has pushed back, declaring himself a “very stable genius” and attacking his critics. <br><br>But no new claims or revelations, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/it-was-an-open-secret/549653/">James Fallows wrote recently for <em>The Atlantic</em></a>, have been more telling than Trump's public behavior.

      <title>How Has America Changed Since 1968?</title>
      <description>As 2018 begins, tensions and tumult in America are high. But before the end of 1968, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/exploring-1968-and-the-making-of-modern-america/549281/"&gt;Conor Friedersdorf reminded us&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, "Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy would be assassinated; U.S. troops would suffer their deadliest year yet in Vietnam—and massacre scores of civilians at My Lai; Richard Nixon would be elected president; the Khmer Rouge would form in Cambodia; humans would orbit the moon; Olympic medal winners in Mexico City would raise their fists in a black power salute; President Johnson would sign the Civil Rights Act of 1968; Yale University would announce that it intended to admit women; &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; would premier; and Led Zeppelin would give their first live performance."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What does that turbulent year have to tell us in this tumultuous moment? What forgotten history is worth revisiting? And in the past half-century, where has the nation made progress, and where has it struggled?

      <title>Putin, Russia, and the End of History</title>
      <description>Vladimir Putin just announced, to the surprise of no one, that he will run for reelection as President of Russia. In her January/February 2018 &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; cover story, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/01/putins-game/546548/"&gt;Julia Ioffe writes&lt;/a&gt; that Americans misunderstand the man ruling the former Soviet empire: he’s not a master tactician playing three-dimensional chess, he’s a gambler who won big. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Over the past year, Russian hackers have become the stuff of legend in the United States," Julia writes. "But most Russians don’t recognize the Russia portrayed in this story." What do they see that we don't? How does America look right now from their vantage point? And what does Vladimir Putin ultimately want?

        <![CDATA[Vladimir Putin just announced, to the surprise of no one, that he will run for reelection as President of Russia. In her January/February 2018 <em>Atlantic</em> cover story, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/01/putins-game/546548/">Julia Ioffe writes</a> that Americans misunderstand the man ruling the former Soviet empire: he’s not a master tactician playing three-dimensional chess, he’s a gambler who won big. <br><br>"Over the past year, Russian hackers have become the stuff of legend in the United States," Julia writes. "But most Russians don’t recognize the Russia portrayed in this story." What do they see that we don't? How does America look right now from their vantage point? And what does Vladimir Putin ultimately want?

      <title>The Manifest Destiny of Mike Pence</title>
      <description>That Pence is the vice president of the United States is "a loaves-and-fishes miracle," &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/01/gods-plan-for-mike-pence/546569/"&gt;writes McKay Coppins&lt;/a&gt; in the latest issue of &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. It's remarkable enough that "an embattled small-state governor with underwater approval ratings, dismal reelection prospects, and a national reputation in tatters" would be chosen as a presidential running mate at all. But unlikelier still is the fact that Pence, known for his devotion to Christ, would become the most prominent character witness for President Donald Trump. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How did Pence reconcile his deeply held Christian values with his defense of Donald Trump after the revelation of the &lt;em&gt;Access Hollywood&lt;/em&gt; recording? Would he support Trump if the presidency were within his own reach? And what do his decisions illuminate about evangelical Christians' attachment to the president? In this conversation, McKay shares what he's learned about Pence from reporting on his stints as governor, radio host, and frat snitch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Links&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;– &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/01/gods-plan-for-mike-pence/546569/"&gt;“God’s Plan for Mike Pence”&lt;/a&gt; (McKay Coppins, January/February 2018 Issue)&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/trump-impeachment/547358/"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;– &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/trump-impeachment/547358/"&gt;“The Odds of Impeachment Are Dropping”&lt;/a&gt; (Peter Beinart, December 3, 2017)&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/12/kushner-israel-trump/547367/"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;– &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/12/kushner-israel-trump/547367/"&gt;“Jared Kushner Responds (Very Briefly) to Flynn's Plea Deal”&lt;/a&gt; (Uri Friedman, December 3, 2017)&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/02/should-christian-bakers-be-allowed-to-refuse-wedding-cakes-to-gays/284061/"&gt;“Should Christian Bakers Be Allowed to Refuse Wedding Cakes to Gays?”&lt;/a&gt; (Conor Friedersdorf, February 25, 2014)&lt;br&gt;– &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/the-gathering-backlash-against-indianas-religious-freedom-law/389162/"&gt;“If Indiana's Religious-Freedom Law Isn't Discriminatory, Why Change It?”&lt;/a&gt; (David A.

      <title>The Great Recession, One Decade Later</title>
      <description>In December 2007, the U.S. marked the beginning of its longest recession since World War II. Now the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency born in the ashes of the nation's economic downturn, is under new leadership that &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/11/cfpb-mulvaney-trump/546131/"&gt;promises big changes&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, a tax plan speeding through Congress could have far-reaching effects on the economy, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/11/health-effects-of-tax-plan/546710/"&gt;well beyond taxes&lt;/a&gt;. On paper, the U.S. economy looks robust. But for whom, and for how long?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This week, Annie Lowrey and Alana Semuels join our hosts to look at what's happened in the decade since the Great Recession, and what's happening now.

      <description>For generations, Hollywood has defined what masculinity means in the U.S., with iconic screen figures such as John Wayne. But Wayne's stoic, taciturn image was the product of a complicated relationship with the director John Ford, one that offers different lessons about masculinity and its constraints. As scandals about men and their behavior fill the news, we discuss the legacy of John Wayne and other male screen icons. Our cohosts are joined by &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; staff writer Megan Garber and Stephen Metcalf, author of the story &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/john-wayne-john-ford/544113/"&gt;"How John Wayne Became a Hollow Masculine Icon."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/john-wayne-john-ford/544113/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/john-wayne-john-ford/544113/?utm_source=feed"&gt;"How John Wayne Became a Hollow Masculine Icon"&lt;/a&gt; (Stephen Metcalf, December 2017 Issue)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/09/the-head-injury-doctrine/540918/'"&gt;"Masculinity Done Well and Poorly"&lt;/a&gt; (James Hamblin, September 25, 2017)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-end-of-men/308135/"&gt;"The End of Men"&lt;/a&gt; (Hanna Rosin, July/August 2010 Issue)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/450501/white-nationalists-alt-right-vague-grievances-what-do-they-want"&gt;"Angry White Boys"&lt;/a&gt; (Kevin D.

      <title>How an American Neo-Nazi Was Made</title>
      <description>Andrew Anglin spent his formative years flirting with hippie progressivism, then tried his hand at becoming a tribal hunter-gatherer. But he only achieved notoriety after he founded the Daily Stormer, the world's biggest website for neo-Nazis. Anglin and his mob of followers have terrorized people around the world, and their influence has been cited by the perpetrators of fatal violence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What lessons should be learned from Anglin's radicalization? And what is society's best response to his ideas? Luke O'Brien and Rosie Gray join Jeff and Matt to discuss these questions, and how far-right extremism is evolving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/the-making-of-an-american-nazi/544119/"&gt;"The Making of an American Nazi"&lt;/a&gt; (Luke O'Brien, December 2017)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/brotherhood-of-losers/544158/"&gt;"The Lost Boys"&lt;/a&gt; (Angela Nagle, December 2017)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/how-2015-fueled-the-rise-of-the-freewheeling-white-nationali?utm_term=.jhoJdPvPm#.dojAZ1r12"&gt;"How 2015 Fueled The Rise Of The Freewheeling, White Nationalist Alt-Movement"&lt;/a&gt; (Rosie Gray, &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;, 12/27/2015)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/02/behind-the-internets-dark-anti-democracy-movement/516243/"&gt;"Behind the Internet's Anti-Democracy Movement"&lt;/a&gt; (Rosie Gray, 2/10/2017)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/alt-right-charlottesville/536736/"&gt;"The Alt-Right's Rebranding Effort Has Failed"&lt;/a&gt; (Rosie Gray, 8/13/2017)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/11/remembering-gwen-ifill/508130/"&gt;"What Gwen Ifill Knew About Race in America"&lt;/a&gt; (Jeffrey Goldberg, 11/18/2016)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/10/joan-didion-doesnt-owe-the-world-anything/544011/"&gt;"Joan Didion Doesn't Owe the World Anything"&lt;/a&gt; (Megan Garber, 10/29/2017)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/"&gt;NoSleep Subreddit&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleepaudio"&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>The Press and the Election of 2016: One Year Later</title>
      <description>It’s a year after Donald Trump's upset election victory. Before and after the 2016 election, President Trump referred to journalists as enemies to himself and to the American people. But his victory wasn’t just a success in vilifying the media, it was a success in manipulating it. Trump was a media figure, skilled at drawing attention. And news organizations were unused to being so squarely part of the story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What lessons have journalists taken from the 2016 campaign and President Trump’s election? What’s changed since then? And what should change going forward? In this episode of Radio Atlantic, Adrienne LaFrance, the editor of TheAtlantic.com, and Yoni Appelbaum, the magazine's politics and policy editor, join Matt and Jeff to look back and look ahead one year after the Trump Era began.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;- "&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/trumps-unwitting-diagnosis-of-american-politics/506738/"&gt;How Trump Diagnosed American Politics&lt;/a&gt;" (Andy Kroll,&amp;nbsp; Nov 7, 2016)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/zuckerberg-2020/513689/"&gt;"Zuckerberg 2020?"&lt;/a&gt; (Adrienne LaFrance, Jan 19,&amp;nbsp; 2017)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/11/one-year-ago-today/545327/"&gt;'We Thought You'd Like to Look Back on This Post from 1 Year Ago’&lt;/a&gt; (Julie Beck, Nov 8, 2017)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/the-atlantic-interview/"&gt;The Atlantic Interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3lX71wNWCj1P8s0Qa4dVVZ?si=EEti2f37"&gt;"The Battle Hymn of the Republic"&lt;/a&gt; (as interpreted by Jon Batiste)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Khizr Khan on What Patriotism Requires</title>
      <description>Since the 2016 election heightened America's deep political divides, the mantle of patriotism has become fodder for a bitter tug-of-war. Is it patriotic to leak a presidential secret? To voice dissent during a national rite? Should a general running the White House be deferred to or defied? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this episode, &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; journalists Krishnadev Calamur and Sigal Samuel talk with Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father whose stirring speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention touched off a famous feud with the President-to-be, about what sacrifice means to him, and why America is worth it. We also hear from a couple veterans who offer their own perspectives on patriotism and military service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To share thoughts, feedback, and questions on the show, leave us a voicemail with your contact info: (202) 266-7600.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/the-anguish-of-john-kelly/543474/"&gt;"The Anguish of John Kelly"&lt;/a&gt; (David Graham, 10/19/2017)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/kneeling-for-life-and-liberty-is-patriotic/540942/"&gt;"Kneeling for Life and Liberty Is Patriotic"&lt;/a&gt; (Conor Friedersdorf, 9/25/2017)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/09/why-cede-the-flag-to-trump/540930/"&gt;"Why Cede the Flag to Donald Trump?"&lt;/a&gt; (David Frum, 9/24/2017)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/01/the-tragedy-of-the-american-military/383516/"&gt;"The Tragedy of the American Military"&lt;/a&gt; (James Fallows, January/February 2015)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2017/07/radio-atlantic-pilot-mine-eyes-have-seen-the-glory/534429/"&gt;"Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory"&lt;/a&gt; (Radio Atlantic, episode one)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/21/opinion/sunday/somalia-mogadishu-bombing-shabab.html"&gt;"My Parents' Country, in the Grip of the Shabab"&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;The New York Times Sunday Review&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXo-qOQNK3E"&gt;"Look at Tiny Baby Hank"&lt;/a&gt; (Vlogbrothers)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Reporting on Open Secrets, with Jodi Kantor and Katie Benner</title>
      <description>Allegations of sexual harassment (and more) by powerful men in numerous industries have been leading news reports across America. On-the-record accounts of disturbing behavior are proliferating. Several leaders of prominent companies have been forced out of their positions. Does this represent a lasting shift in attitudes toward scandalous conduct, or will the public's interest in these matters subside? Is this a tipping point, in other words, or a flash point?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The journalism of Jodi Kantor, Katie Benner, and their colleagues at &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; has been a major catalyst for putting this issue at the top of the national agenda. Kantor and her reporting partner Megan Twohey shared a byline on the October 5 investigation revealing &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html"&gt;three decades of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein&lt;/a&gt;. As a technology reporter based in Silicon Valley, Benner has chronicled &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fkatie-benner"&gt;numerous reports of predatory behavior&lt;/a&gt; by investors, founders, and other influential figures in the tech industry. In this episode of Radio Atlantic, Kantor and Benner join Alex and Matt to discuss what they've discovered in their reporting, and where they think it will lead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html"&gt;"Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for Decades"&lt;/a&gt; (Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, 10/5/2017)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/business/harvey-weinstein.html"&gt;"How the Harvey Weinstein Story Has Unfolded"&lt;/a&gt; (Daniel Victor, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, 10/18/2017)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html"&gt;"Women in Tech Speak Frankly on Culture of Harassment"&lt;/a&gt; (Katie Benner, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, 6/30/2017)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/technology/sofi-chief-executive-toxic-workplace.html"&gt;"'It Was a Frat House': Inside the Sex Scandal That Toppled SoFi's C.E.O."&lt;/a&gt; (Katie Benner and Nathaniel Popper, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;) | &lt;a href="https://www.sofi.com/blog/responding-to-the-new-york-times/"&gt;SoFi's response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/10/the-harvey-effect-reaches-leon-wieseltier/543897/"&gt;“The ‘Harvey Effect’ Takes Down Leon Wieseltier’s Magazine”&lt;/a&gt; (Adrienne LaFrance, &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, 10/24/2017)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-and-the-economics-of-consent/543618/"&gt;"Harvey Weinstein and the Economics of Consent"&lt;/a&gt; (Brit Marling, &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, 10/23/2017)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTMow_7H47Q"&gt;"Girl at a Bar"&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="https://gimletmedia.com/startup/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Startup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, especially seasons &lt;a href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/all/season-2/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/all/season-4/"&gt;four&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/the-burning-girl/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Burning Girl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Claire Messud)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/The-Color-of-Law/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Color of Law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(Richard Rothstein)&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="http://uncivil.show/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncivil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://podcast.cdsporch.org/seeing-white/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scene on Radio: Seeing White&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Why Do Happy People Cheat?</title>
      <description>"Infidelity," &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/10/why-happy-people-cheat/537882/"&gt;Esther Perel writes&lt;/a&gt; in the October issue of &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, "happens in bad marriages and in good marriages. It happens even in open relationships where extramarital sex is carefully negotiated beforehand. The freedom to leave or divorce has not made cheating obsolete." Adultery is as ancient as marriage, and as contemporary relationships have evolved, Perel writes, the causes and consequences of infidelity have much to teach us about the nature of commitment.&amp;nbsp; In this conversation, Perel talks with our hosts about some of those lessons, culled from numerous sessions counseling couples as a psychotherapist. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perel is the author of &lt;a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/web-sampler/9780060753641"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mating in Captivity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;and the host of &lt;a href="http://audible.com/esther"&gt;"Where Should We Begin?"&lt;/a&gt;—an Audible original series entering its second season on October 24th.

      <description>"Winter is coming," they warned us, and the seventh season of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; might have proved them right.

      <title>Are Smartphones Harming Our Kids?</title>
      <description>It's been ten years since the iPhone came out, and now the first generation to grow up with smartphones is coming of age. Jean Twenge, a psychologist who has studied generational behaviors, has found troubling signals that these devices seem to be taking a visible toll on the mental health of post-Millennials. In the September 2017 issue of &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, Twenge shares her findings in a story adapted from her new book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1501151983/theatla05-20/"&gt;iGen: Why Today’s Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy—and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood—and What That Means for the Rest of Us&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this episode, we talk with Twenge about her findings, hear from a few members of the post-Millennial generation about their relationships with their devices, and discuss what the research means for parents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For links and other show notes, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/1857/11/radio-atlantic-are-smartphones-harming-kids/537981/"&gt;go here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <description>After white supremacists and neo-Nazis rallied in Virginia, resulting in the deaths of three Americans, President Trump's equivocating responses shocked Republicans and Democrats alike. Did this represent a major breakpoint in American politics? Why have Confederate symbols and ideas suddenly returned to the public sphere, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/08/no-confederate/535512/"&gt;not to mention HBO&lt;/a&gt;?

      <title>Kurt Andersen on How America Lost Its Mind</title>
      <description>When did the reality-based community start losing to reality show celebrity? Why are "alternative facts" and fake news suddenly ubiquitous features of the landscape? The spread of American magical thinking isn't, in fact, sudden, argues Kurt Andersen &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/how-america-lost-its-mind/534231/"&gt;in the September 2017 &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

In that story, Bowden laid out the four options a U.S. administration has for handling North Korea's nuclear ambitions—trying to prevent its progress, turning the screws on the country's leadership, decapitating its leaders, and accepting that a nuclear North Korea is inevitable—and why all of those options are bad. In this conversation, he talks about how this week's news affects that calculus, and whether any one of those paths has grown more likely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a bonus episode.

And we present the world premiere of Jon Batiste's Battle Hymn of the Republic, reimagined for the magazine that first published it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For links and other show notes, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/press-releases/archive/1857/11/radio-atlantic-pilot-mine-eyes-have-seen-the-glory/534429/?utm_source=megaphone"&gt;visit this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.
