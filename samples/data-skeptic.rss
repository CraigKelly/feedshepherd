			<description><![CDATA[<h1>Announcing Journal Club</h1> <p>I am pleased to announce Data Skeptic is launching a new spin-off show called "Journal Club" with similar themes but a very different format to the Data Skeptic everyone is used to.</p> <p>In Journal Club, we will have a regular panel and occasional guest panelists to discuss interesting news items and one featured journal article every week in a roundtable discussion. Each week, I'll be joined by Lan Guo and George Kemp for a discussion of interesting data science related news articles and a featured journal or pre-print article.</p> <p>We hope that this podcast will give listeners an introduction to the works we cover and how people discuss these works. Our topics will often coincide with the original Data Skeptic podcast's current Interpretability theme, but we have few rules right now or what we pick. We enjoy discussing these items with each other and we hope you will do.</p> <p>In the coming weeks, we will start opening up the guest chair more often to bring new voices to our discussion. After that we'll be looking for ways we can engage with our audience.</p> <p>Keep reading and thanks for listening!</p> <p>Kyle</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A Click Through Rate (CTR) is the proportion of clicks to impressions of some item of content shared online. This terminology is most commonly used in digital advertising but applies just as well to content websites might choose to feature on their homepage or in search results.</p> <p>A CTR is intuitively appealing as a metric for optimization. After all, if users are disinterested in some content, under normal circumstances, it's reasonable to assume they would ignore the content, rather than clicking on it. On the other hand, the best content is likely to elicit a high CTR as users signal their interest by following the hyperlink.</p> <p>In the advertising world, a website could charge per impression, per click, or per action. Both impression and action based pricing have asymmetrical results for the publisher and advertiser. However, paying per click (CPC based advertising) seems to strike a nice balance. For this and other numeric reasons, many digital advertising mechanisms (such as Google Adwords) use CPC as the payment mechanism.</p> <p>When charging per click, an advertising platform will value a high CTR when selecting which ad to show. As we learned in our episode on <a href= "https://dataskeptic.com/blog/episodes/2016/goodharts-law">Goodhart's Law</a>, once a measure is turned into a target, it ceases to be a good measure. While CTR alone does not entirely drive most online advertising algorithms, it does play an important role. Thus, advertisers are incentivized to adopt strategies that maximize CTR.</p> <p>On the surface, this sounds like a great idea: provide internet users what they are looking for, and be awarded with their attention and lower advertising costs. However, one possible unintended consequence of this type of optimization is the creation of ads which are designed solely to generate clicks, regardless of if the users are happy with the page they visit after clicking a link.</p> <p>So, at least in part, websites that optimize for higher CTRs are going to favor content that does a good job getting viewers to click it. Getting a user to <em>view</em> a page is not totally synonymous with getting a user to <em>appreciate</em> the content of a page. The gap between the algorithmic goal and the user experience could be one of the factors that has promoted the creation of fake news.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's spam filters are advanced data driven tools. They rely on a variety of techniques to effectively and often seamlessly filter out junk email from good email.</p> <p>Whitelists, blacklists, traffic analysis, network analysis, and a variety of other tools are probably employed by most major players in this area. Naturally content analysis can be an especially powerful tool for detecting spam.</p> <p>Given the binary nature of the problem (<img src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/Spam.svg" alt= "Spam" /> or <img src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/l_%5C%5Cneg+Spam.svg" alt="\neg Spam" />) its clear that this is a great problem to use machine learning to solve. In order to apply machine learning, you first need a labelled training set. Thankfully, many standard corpora of labelled spam data are readily available. Further, if you're working for a company with a spam filtering problem, often asking users to self-moderate or flag things as spam can be an effective way to generate a large amount of labels for "free".</p> <p>With a labeled dataset in hand, a data scientist working on spam filtering must next do feature engineering. This should be done with consideration of the algorithm that will be used. The Naive Bayesian Classifer has been a popular choice for detecting spam because it tends to perform pretty well on high dimensional data, unlike a lot of other ML algorithms. It also is very efficient to compute, making it possible to train a per-user Classifier if one wished to. While we might do some basic NLP tricks, for the most part, we can turn each word in a document (or perhaps each bigram or n-gram in a document) into a feature.</p> <p>The <em>Naive</em> part of the Naive Bayesian Classifier stems from the naive assumption that all features in one's analysis are considered to be independent. If <img src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/x.svg" alt= "x" /> and <img src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/y.svg" alt= "y" /> are known to be independent, then <img src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/Pr%28x+%5C%5Ccap+y%29+%253D+Pr%28x%29+%5C%5Ccdot+Pr%28y%29.svg" alt="Pr(x \cap y) = Pr(x) \cdot Pr(y)" />. In other words, you just multiply the probabilities together. Shh, don't tell anyone, but this assumption is actually wrong! Certainly, if a document contains the word <em>algorithm</em>, it's more likely to contain the word <em>probability</em> than some randomly selected document. Thus, <img style= "box-sizing: border-box; outline: none; border: 0px; vertical-align: middle; max-width: 100%;" src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/Pr%28%5C%5Ctext%7Balgorithm%7D+%5C%5Ccap+%5C%5Ctext%7Bprobability%7D%29+%253E+Pr%28%5C%5Ctext%7Balgorithm%7D%29+%5C%5Ccdot+Pr%28%5C%5Ctext%7Bprobability%7D%29.svg" alt= "Pr(\text{algorithm} \cap \text{probability}) > Pr(\text{algorithm}) \cdot Pr(\text{probability})" />, violating the assumption. Despite this "flaw", the Naive Bayesian Classifier works remarkably will on many problems. If one employs the common approach of converting a document into bigrams (pairs of words instead of single words), then you can capture a good deal of this correlation indirectly.</p> <p>In the final leg of the discussion, we explore the question of whether or not a Naive Bayesian Classifier would be a good choice for detecting fake news.</p> <div class="blog-related-content-container"> </div> <div class="blog-share-bar-container"> </div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Algorithms with similar runtimes are said to be in the same complexity class.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Animals can't tell us when they're experiencing pain, so we have to rely on other cues to help treat their discomfort. But it is often difficult to tell how much an animal is suffering. The sheep, for instance, is the most inscrutable of animals. However, scientists have figured out a way to understand sheep facial expressions using artificial intelligence.</p> <p>On this week's episode, Dr. Marwa Mahmoud from the University of Cambridge joins us to discuss her recent study, "<a href= "http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pr10/publications/fg17.pdf">Estimating Sheep Pain Level Using Facial Action Unit Detection</a>." Marwa and her colleague's at Cambridge's Computer Laboratory developed an automated system using machine learning algorithms to detect and assess when a sheep is in pain. We discuss some details of her work, how she became interested in studying sheep facial expression to measure pain, and her future goals for this project.</p> <p>If you're able to be in Minneapolis, MN on August 23rd or 24th, consider attending Farcon.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Max-pooling is a procedure in a neural network which has several benefits. It performs dimensionality reduction by taking a collection of neurons and reducing them to a single value for future layers to receive as input. It can also prevent overfitting, since it takes a large set of inputs and admits only one value, making it harder to memorize the input. In this episode, we discuss the intuitive interpretation of max-pooling and why it's more common than mean-pooling or (theoretically) quartile-pooling.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>No reliable, complete database cataloging home sales data at a transaction level is available for the average person to access. To a data scientist interesting in studying this data, our hands are complete tied. Opportunities like testing sociological theories, exploring economic impacts, study market forces, or simply research the value of an investment when buying a home are all blocked by the lack of easy access to this dataset. OpenHouse seeks to correct that by centralizing and standardizing all publicly available home sales transactional data.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No reliable, complete database cataloging home sales data at a transaction level is available for the average person to access. To a data scientist interesting in studying this data, our hands are complete tied. Opportunities like testing sociological theories, exploring economic impacts, study market forces, or simply research the value of an investment when buying a home are all blocked by the lack of easy access to this dataset. OpenHouse seeks to correct that by centralizing and standardizing all publicly available home sales transactional data.

			<description><![CDATA[<h2>Feed Forward Neural Networks</h2> <p>In a feed forward neural network, neurons cannot form a cycle. In this episode, we explore how such a network would be able to represent three common logical operators: OR, AND, and XOR. The XOR operation is the interesting case.</p> <p>Below are the truth tables that describe each of these functions.</p> <h3>AND Truth Table</h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th align="center">Input 1</th> <th align="center">Input 2</th> <th align="center">Output</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">0</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">0</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">0</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">1</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>OR Truth Table</h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th align="center">Input 1</th> <th align="center">Input 2</th> <th align="center">Output</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">0</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">1</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>XOR Truth Table</h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th align="center">Input 1</th> <th align="center">Input 2</th> <th align="center">Output</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">0</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">0</td> <td align="center">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">1</td> <td align="center">0</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The AND and OR functions should seem very intuitive. Exclusive or (XOR) if true if and only if exactly single input is 1. Could a neural network learn these mathematical functions?</p> <p>Let's consider the perceptron described below. First we see the visual representation, then the Activation function <img src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic.com/latex/25e26f99186ea1ba5b80cec1e7917d8896843465.svg" alt="A" />, followed by the formula for calculating the output.</p> <p> </p> <center> <p> </p> <p><img src= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic-static/img/2017/img1.svg" alt="" /></p> <p><img src= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/dataskeptic-static/img/2017/activation_func.svg" alt="" /></p> <p><img src= "http://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.dataskeptic.com/latex/10136c2573d6998d27536bd440338884c46265f2.svg" alt= "Output = A(w_0 \cdot Bias + w_1 \cdot Input_1 + w_2 \cdot Input_2)" /></p> <p> </p> </center> <p> </p> <p>Can this perceptron learn the AND function?</p> <p>Sure.

This is also a good example of why the bias term is important.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today's episode overviews the perceptron algorithm. This rather simple approach is characterized by a few particular features. It updates its weights after seeing every example, rather than as a batch. It uses a step function as an activation function. It's only appropriate for linearly separable data, and it will converge to a solution if the data meets these criteria. Being a fairly simple algorithm, it can run very efficiently.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If a CEO wants to know the state of their business, they ask their highest ranking executives. These executives, in turn, should know the state of the business through reports from their subordinates. This structure is roughly analogous to a process observed in deep learning, where each layer of the business reports up different types of observations, KPIs, and reports to be interpreted by the next layer of the business. In deep learning, this process can be thought of as automated feature engineering. DNNs built to recognize objects in images may learn structures that behave like edge detectors in the first hidden layer. Proceeding layers learn to compose more abstract features from lower level outputs. This episode explore that analogy in the context of automated feature engineering.</p> <p>Linh Da and Kyle discuss a particular image in this episode. The image included below in the show notes is drawn from the work of Lee, Grosse, Ranganath, and Ng in their paper <a href= "http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/icml09-cdbn.pdf">Convolutional Deep Belief Networks for Scalable Unsupervised Learning of Hierarchical Representations</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p><img src= "http://localhost:3000/blog/episodes/2017/src-automated-feature-engineering/features.png" alt="" width="447" height="245" /></p>]]></description>

His work exploring the topic of auditing algorithms has framed the conversation of how and why we might want to have oversight on the way algorithms effect our lives.

<p>A recent paper in the journal of Judgment and Decision Making titled <a href="http://journal.sjdm.org/15/15923a/jdm15923a.pdf">On the reception and detection of pseudo-profound bullshit</a> explores empirical questions around a reader's ability to detect statements which may sound profound but are actually a collection of buzzwords that fail to contain adequate meaning or truth. These statements are definitively different from lies and nonesense, as we discuss in the episode.</p>
<p>This paper proposes the Bullshit Receptivity scale (BSR) and empirically demonstrates that it correlates with existing metrics like the Cognitive Reflection Test, building confidence that this can be a useful, repeatable, empirical measure of a person's ability to detect pseudo-profound statements as being different from genuinely profound statements. Additionally, the correlative results provide some insight into possible root causes for why individuals might find great profundity in these statements based on other beliefs or cognitive measures.</p>
<p>The paper's lead author <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/psychology/people-profiles/gordon-pennycook">Gordon Pennycook</a> joins me to discuss this study's results.</p>
<p>If you'd like some examples of pseudo-profound bullshit, you can randomly generate some based on <a href="http://www.wisdomofchopra.com/">Deepak Chopra</a>'s twitter feed.</p>

<p>And just for fun, if you think you've dreamed up a Data Skeptic related pseudo-profound bullshit statement, tweet it with hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pseudoprofound&src=typd">#pseudoprofound</a>.

<p><a href="http://cmsw.mit.edu/profile/tom-levenson/">Thomas Levenson</a>'s book "The Hunt for Vulcan" is a narrative of the key scientific minds involved in the search and eventual refutation of an unobserved planet between Mercury and the sun.

<p>During the discussion, we mention one of the contributions made by Urbain-Jean-Joseph Le Verrier which involved some complex calculations which enabled him to predict where to find the planet that would eventually be called Neptune. The calculus behind this work is difficult, and some of that work is demonstrated in a Jupyter notebook I recently discovered from <a href="http://pmarques.eu/">Paulo Marques</a> titled <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pjpmarques/Julia-Modeling-the-World/blob/master/Three-Body%20Problem.ipynb">The-Body Problem</a>.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>... or should this have been called data science from a neuroscientist's perspective? Either way, I'm sure you'll enjoy this discussion with <a href="https://twitter.com/laurieskelly">Laurie Skelly</a>. Laurie earned a PhD in Integrative Neuroscience from the Department of Psychology at the University of Chicago. In her life as a social neuroscientist, using fMRI to study the neural processes behind empathy and psychopathy, she learned the ropes of zooming in and out between the macroscopic and the microscopic -- how millions of data points come together to tell us something meaningful about human nature. She's currently at <a href="http://www.thisismetis.com/">Metis Data Science</a>, an organization that helps people learn the skills of data science to transition in industry.</p>
<p>In this episode, we discuss fMRI technology, Laurie's research studying empathy and psychopathy, as well as the skills and tools used in common between neuroscientists and data scientists. For listeners interested in more on this subject, Laurie recommended the blogs <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/">Neuroskeptic</a>, <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/">Neurocritic</a>, and <a href="https://neuroecology.wordpress.com/">Neuroecology</a>.</p>
<p>We conclude the episode with a mention of the upcoming Metis Data Science San Francisco cohort which Laurie will be teaching. If anyone is interested in applying to participate, they can do so <a href="http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science/apply">here</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A discussion of the expected number of cars at a stoplight frames today's discussion of the bias variance tradeoff. The central ideal of this concept relates to model complexity. A very simple model will likely generalize well from training to testing data, but will have a very high variance since it's simplicity can prevent it from capturing the relationship between the covariates and the output. As a model grows more and more complex, it may capture more of the underlying data but the risk that it overfits the training data and therefore does not generalize (is biased) increases. The tradeoff between minimizing variance and minimizing bias is an ongoing challenge for data scientists, and an important discussion for skeptics around how much we should trust models.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The multi-armed bandit problem is named with reference to slot machines (one armed bandits). Given the chance to play from a pool of slot machines, all with unknown payout frequencies, how can you maximize your reward? If you knew in advance which machine was best, you would play exclusively that machine. Any strategy less than this will, on average, earn less payout, and the difference can be called the "regret".</p>
<p>You can try each slot machine to learn about it, which we refer to as exploration. When you've spent enough time to be convinced you've identified the best machine, you can then double down and exploit that knowledge. But how do you best balance exploration and exploitation to minimize the regret of your play?</p>
<p>This mini-episode explores a few examples including restaurant selection and A/B testing to discuss the nature of this problem. In the end we touch briefly on Thompson sampling as a solution.</p>]]></description>

With an increasing number of features to consider, machine learning algorithms suffer from the curse of dimensionality, as they have a wider set and often sparser coverage of examples to consider. This episode explores a real life example of this as Kyle and Linhda discuss their thoughts on purchasing a home.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #224422; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">The curse of dimensionality was defined by Richard Bellman, and applies in several slightly nuanced cases. This mini-episode discusses how it applies on machine learning.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: #224422; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">This episode does not, however, discuss a slightly different version of the curse of dimensionality which appears in decision theoretic situations. Consider the game of chess. One must think ahead several moves in order to execute a successful strategy. However, thinking ahead another move requires a consideration of every possible move of every piece controlled, and every possible response one's opponent may take. The space of possible future states of the board grows exponentially with the horizon one wants to look ahead to. This is present in the notably useful <a style="color: #337ab7; text-decoration: none; background-color: transparent;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation">Bellman equation</a>.</p>]]></description>

<p>In this solo episode, Kyle proposes the concept of "annoyance mining" - the idea that with proper logging and enough feedback, data scientists could be provided the right dataset from which they can detect flaws and annoyances in software and other systems and automatically detect potential bugs, flaws, and improvements which could make those systems better.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="color: #224422; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">Have you ever wondered what is lost when you compress a song into an MP3? This week's guest Ryan Maguire did more than that. He worked on software to issolate the sounds that are lost when you convert a lossless digital audio recording into a compressed MP3 file.</p>
<p style="color: #224422; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">To complete his project, Ryan worked primarily in python using the <a href="http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/software/pyo/">pyo</a> library as well as the <a href="https://github.com/bregmanstudio/BregmanToolkit">Bregman Toolkit</a></p>
<p style="color: #224422; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">Ryan mentioned humans having a dynamic range of hearing from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNf9nzvnd1k">20 hz to 20,000 hz</a>, if you'd like to hear those tones, check the previous link.</p>
<p style="color: #224422; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;">If you'd like to know more about our guest <a href="http://www.ryanmaguiremusic.com/">Ryan Maguire</a><a> you can find his website at the previous link.

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">Guest Youyou Wu discuses the work she and her collaborators did to measure the accuracy of computer based personality judgments. Using Facebook "like" data, they found that machine learning approaches could be used to estimate user's self assessment of the "big five" personality traits: openness, agreeableness, extraversion, conscientiousness, and neuroticism. Interestingly, the computer-based assessments outperformed some of the assessments of certain groups of human beings. Listen to the episode to learn more.</p>
<p style="color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">The original paper <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/4/1036.full.pdf+html">Computer-based personality judgements are more accurate than those made by humans</a>appeared in the January 2015 volume of the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">For her benevolent Youyou recommends <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802.full">Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior</a> by Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell, and Thore Graepel. It's a similar paper by her co-authors which looks at demographic traits rather than personality traits.</p>
<p style="color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">And for her self-serving recommendation, Youyou has a link that I'm very excited about. You can visit<a href="http://applymagicsauce.com/">ApplyMagicSauce.com</a> to see how this model evaluates <em>your</em> personality based on your Facebook like information.

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">This episode introduces the idea of a Markov Chain. A Markov Chain has a set of states describing a particular system, and a probability of moving from one state to another along every valid connected state. Markov Chains are memoryless, meaning they don't rely on a long history of previous observations. The current state of a system depends only on the previous state and the results of a random outcome.</p>
<p style="color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">Markov Chains are a useful way method for describing non-deterministic systems. They are useful for destribing the state and transition model of a stochastic system.</p>
<p style="color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">As examples of Markov Chains, we discuss stop light signals, bowling, and text prediction systems in light of whether or not they can be described with Markov Chains.</p>]]></description>

This paper studies data collected from social networks and how the sharing behaviors of individuals can unintentionally reveal private information about other people, including those that have not even joined the social network!

As Emre points out, this is a small shadow of the potential information available to modern social networks. For example, users that install the Facebook app on their mobile phones are (perhaps unknowningly) sharing all their phone contacts.

Thanks to listener Sara L who wrote in to point out the Data Skeptic Podcast has focused alot about <em>using</em> data to be skeptical, but not necessarily being skeptical <em>of</em> data.</p>
<p style="color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">Data Provenance is the concept of knowing the full origin of your dataset. Where did it come from? Who collected it? How as it collected? Does it combine independent sources or one singular source? What are the error bounds on the way it was measured? These are just some of the questions one should ask to understand their data. After all, if the antecedent of an argument is built on dubious grounds, the consequent of the argument is equally dubious.</p>
<p style="color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">For a more technical discussion than what we get into in this mini epiosode, I recommend <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/pub/techreports/TR618.pdf">A Survey of Data Provenance Techniques</a> by authors Simmhan, Plale, and Gannon.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">Economist Peter Backus joins me in this episode to discuss a few interesting topics. You may recall Linhda and I previously discussed his paper "<a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/pbackus/girlfriend">The Girlfriend Equation</a>" on a recent mini-episode. We start by touching base on this fun paper and get a follow up on where Peter stands years after writing w.r.t. a successful romantic union. Additionally, we delve in to some fascinating economics topics.</p>
<p style="color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">We touch on questions of the role models, for better or for worse, played a role in the ~2008 economic crash, statistics in economics and the difficulty of measurement, and some insightful discussion about the economics charities. Peter encourages listeners to be open to giving money to charities that are good at fundraising, and his arguement is a (for me) suprisingly insightful logic. Lastly, we have a teaser of some of Peter's upcoming work using unconventional data sources.</p>
<p style="color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">For his benevolent recommendation, Peter recommended the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Conquest-Happiness-Bertrand-Russell/dp/0871401622">The Conquest of Happiness</a> by Bertrand Russell, and for his self-serving recommendation, follow Peter on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/Awesomnomics">@Awesomnomics</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">Can algorithms help you find love? Many happy couples successfully brought together via online dating websites show us that data science can help you find love. I'm joined this week by Thomas Levi, Senior Data Scientist at <a href="http://www.pof.com/">Plenty of Fish</a>, to discuss some of his work which helps people find one another as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p style="color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">Matchmaking is a truly non-trivial problem, and one that's dynamically changing all the time as new users join and leave the "pool of fish". This episode explores the aspects of what makes this a tough problem and some of the ways POF has been successfully using data science to solve it, and continues to try to innovate with new techniques like interest matching.</p>
<p style="color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">For his benevolent references, Thomas suggests readers check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/All-Statistics-Statistical-Inference-Springer/dp/0387402721">All of Statistics</a> as well as the <a href="http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html">caret</a>library for R.

			<description><![CDATA[<p style=
"color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">
This week's episode explores the possibilities of extracting novel
insights from the many great social web APIs available. Matthew
Russell's <a href="http://miningthesocialweb.com/">Mining the
Social Web</a> is a fantastic exploration of the tools and
methods, and we explore a few related topics.</p>
<p style=
"color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">
One helpful feature of the book is it's use of a <a href=
"https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> virtual machine.
Using it, readers can easily reproduce the examples from the book,
and there's a short video available that will walk you
through <a href="http://vimeo.com/72383764">setting up the
Mining the Social Web virtual machine</a>.</p>
<p style=
"color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">
The book also has an accompanying github repository which can be
found <a href=
"https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition">here</a>.</p>
<p style=
"color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">
A quote from Matthew that particularly reasonates for me was "The
first commandment of Data Science is to 'Know thy data'." Take a
listen for a little more context around this sage advice.</p>
<p style=
"color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">
In addition to the book, we also discuss some of the work done
by <a href="http://www.digitalreasoning.com/">Digital
Reasoning</a> where Matthew serves as CTO. One of their
products we spend some time discussing is <a href=
"http://www.digitalreasoning.com/uncommon-technology/intro-synthesys">Synthesys</a>,
a service that processes unstructured data and delivers knowledge
and insight extracted from the data.</p>
<p style=
"color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">
Some listeners might already be familiar with Digital Reasoning
from recent coverage in Fortune Magazine on their <a href=
"http://fortune.com/2014/08/14/digital-reasoning-cognitive-computing/">cognitive
computing</a> efforts.</p>
<p style=
"color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">
For his benevolent recommendation, Matthew recommends
the <a href=
"http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/">Hardcore
History Podcast</a>, and for his self-serving recommendation,
Matthew mentioned that they are currently hiring for <a href=
"http://www.digitalreasoning.com/careers">Data Science job
opportunities at Digital Reasoning</a> if any listeners are
looking for new opportunities.</p>]]></description>

"color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">
The book also has an accompanying github repository which can be
found <a href=
"https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition">here</a>.</p>
<p style=
"color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">
A quote from Matthew that particularly reasonates for me was "The
first commandment of Data Science is to 'Know thy data'." Take a
listen for a little more context around this sage advice.</p>
<p style=
"color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">
In addition to the book, we also discuss some of the work done
by <a href="http://www.digitalreasoning.com/">Digital
Reasoning</a> where Matthew serves as CTO. One of their
products we spend some time discussing is <a href=
"http://www.digitalreasoning.com/uncommon-technology/intro-synthesys">Synthesys</a>,
a service that processes unstructured data and delivers knowledge
and insight extracted from the data.</p>
<p style=
"color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">
Some listeners might already be familiar with Digital Reasoning
from recent coverage in Fortune Magazine on their <a href=
"http://fortune.com/2014/08/14/digital-reasoning-cognitive-computing/">cognitive
computing</a> efforts.</p>
<p style=
"color: #224422; font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">
For his benevolent recommendation, Matthew recommends
the <a href=
"http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/">Hardcore
History Podcast</a>, and for his self-serving recommendation,
Matthew mentioned that they are currently hiring for <a href=
"http://www.digitalreasoning.com/careers">Data Science job
opportunities at Digital Reasoning</a> if any listeners are
looking for new opportunities.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This episode explores the basis of why we can trust encryption.  Suprisingly, a discussion of looking up a word in the dictionary (binary search) and efficiently going wine tasting (the travelling salesman problem) help introduce computational complexity as well as the P ?= NP question, which is paramount to the trustworthiness RSA encryption.</p>
<p>With a high level foundation of computational theory, we talk about NP problems, and why prime factorization is a difficult problem, thus making it a great basis for the RSA encryption algorithm, which most of the internet uses to encrypt data.  Unlike the encryption scheme Ray Romano used in "Everybody Loves Raymond", RSA has nice theoretical foundations.</p>
<p>It should be noted that although this episode gives good reason to trust that properly encrypted data, based on well choosen public/private keys where the private key is not compromised, is safe.  However, having safe encryption doesn't necessarily mean that the Internet is secure.  Topics like Man in the Middle attacks as well as the Snowden revelations are a topic for another day, not for this record length "mini" episode.</p>]]></description>

Listeners are encouraged to put their data science skills to good use, or if all else fails, guess!</p>
<p style="color: rgb(34, 68, 34); font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">The contest works as follows. Below is some data about the cumulative number of downloads the podcast has achieved on a few given dates. Your job is to predict the date and time at which the podcast will recieve download number 27,182. Why this arbitrary number? It's as good as any other arbitrary number!</p>
<p style="color: rgb(34, 68, 34); font-family: 'Lucida Bright', Georgia, serif; font-size: medium;">Use whatever means you want to formulate a prediction. Once you have it, wait until that time and then post a review of the Data Skeptic Podcast on iTunes. You don't even have to leave a good review! The review which is posted closest to the actual time at which this download occurs will win a free copy of Matthew Russell's "Mining the Social Web" courtesy of the Data Skeptic Podcast. "Price is Right" rules are in play - the winner is the person that posts their review closest to the actual time without going over.</p>

Regardless, listeners of the Data Skeptic Podcast are encouraged to explore the back catalog to try and find the aforementioned episode of this great podcast. Last but not least, as mentioned in the outro, <a style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium;" href="http://www.awesomedice.com/blog/353/d20-dice-randomness-test-chessex-vs-gamescience/">awesomedice.com</a> did some great independent empirical testing that confirms Game Science dice are much closer to the desired uniform distribution over possible outcomes when compared to one leading manufacturer.</p>]]></content:encoded>
