      <description>“I discovered the reality and the power of Palestinian identity by getting a rock thrown at my head.” Israel author Yossi Klein Halevi joins &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;'s editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg to discuss the conflict in the Middle East and his new book &lt;a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062844910/letters-to-my-palestinian-neighbor"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Letters to My Palestinian Neighbor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Mitch Landrieu</title>
      <description>"There is a difference between remembrance of history and reverence of it," said New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu in his &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/we-cant-walk-away-from-this-truth/527721/"&gt;now-famous speech&lt;/a&gt; in May of 2017. As Landrieu said those words, city workers a few blocks away uprooted an enormous statue of Robert E. Lee – the last of four Confederate monuments the mayor removed from the city after a years-long process. In a conversation with &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;'s editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg, Landrieu discusses the politics of race in the south, his grappling with history as a white southerner, and his own family’s connection to the story of civil rights in America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Caitlin Flanagan</title>
      <description>Caitlin Flanagan wrote a devastating story about the death of a fraternity pledge at Penn State University for the Atlantic last year, and she has updates on the case for editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg. They discuss why fraternities are still attractive to straight, white, well-off young men on college campuses. Flanagan has also started fighting feminists, with her provocative essays on how some women are turning the #MeToo movement into a racket. She sees some women using the moment to take revenge against individual men while doing nothing to topple the patriarchy. She talks about why millennial women are confused and angry about their sexual encounters. She also says that our fear of toxic masculinity is crowding out an honest look at toxic femininity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Nikole Hannah-Jones</title>
      <description>Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief, talks about America's unequal education system with journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones.

And she has some concrete—but difficult—ideas for fixing it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/12/progressives-are-undermining-pubic-schools/548084/"&gt;Read the transcript&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.
