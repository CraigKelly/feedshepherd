Here are Neil's five papers. What are yours?

Stochastic variational inference by Hoffman, Wang, Blei and Paisley

http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.7051

A way of doing approximate inference for probabilistic models with potentially billions of data ... need I say more?




Austerity in MCMC Land: Cutting the Metropolis Hastings by Korattikara, Chen and Welling

http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5299

Oh ... I do need to say more ... because these three are at it as well but from the sampling perspective. Probabilistic models for big data ... an idea so important it needed to be in the list twice. 




Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms by Snoek, Larochelle and Adams

http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2944

This paper represents the rise in probabilistic numerics, I could also have chosen papers by Osborne, Hennig or others. There are too many papers out there already. Definitely an exciting area, be it optimisation, integration, differential equations. I chose this paper because it seems to have blown the field open to a wider audience, focussing as it did on deep learning as an application, so it let's me capture both an area of developing interest and an area that hits the national news.




Kernel Bayes Rule by Fukumizu, Song, Gretton

http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.5736

One of the great things about ML is how we have different (and competing) philosophies operating under the same roof. But because we still talk to each other (and sometimes even listen to each other)  these ideas can merge to create new and interesting things. Kernel Bayes Rule makes the list.




http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/imagenet.pdf

There are too many papers out there already. Definitely an exciting area, be it optimisation, integration, differential equations.

      <itunes:summary>In episode 9 of season 4 we talk about the Statement on Nature Machine Intelligence. We reached out to Nature for a statement on the statement and received the following:

“At Springer Nature we are very clear in our mission to advance discovery and help researchers share their work. Having an extensive, and growing, open access portfolio is one important way we do this but it is important to remember that while open access has been around for 20 years now it still only accounts for a small percentage of overall global research output with demand for subscription content remaining high. This is because the move to open access is complex, and for many, simply not a viable option.

Nature Machine Intelligence is a new subscription journal that aims to stimulate cross-disciplinary interactions, reach broad audiences and explore the impact that AI research has on other fields by publishing high-quality research, reviews and commentary on machine learning, robotics and AI. It involves substantial editorial development, offers high levels of author service and publishes informative, accessible content beyond primary research all of which requires considerable investment. At present, we believe that the fairest way of producing highly selective journals like this one and ensuring their long-term sustainability as a resource for the widest possible community, is to spread these costs among many readers — instead of having them borne by a few authors.   

 We also offer multiple open access options for AI authors. We already publish AI papers in Scientific Reports and Nature Communications, which are the largest open access journal in the world and the most cited open access journal respectively. We offer hybrid publishing options and are set to launch a new AI multidisciplinary, open access journal later this year.

We help all researchers to freely share their discoveries by encouraging preprint posting and data- and code-sharing and continue to extend access to all Nature journals in various ways, including our free SharedIt content-sharing initiative, which provides authors and subscribers with shareable links to view-only versions of published papers.”

We already publish AI papers in&nbsp;<em>Scientific Reports</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Nature Communications</em>, which are the largest open access journal in the world and the most cited open access journal respectively. We offer hybrid publishing options and are set to launch a new AI multidisciplinary, open access journal later this year.</p><p>We help all researchers to freely share their discoveries by encouraging <a href="https://www.nature.com/authors/policies/preprints.html" target="_blank">preprint posting</a> and<a href="https://www.nature.com/authors/policies/availability.html" target="_blank"> data- and code-sharing</a> and continue to extend access to all Nature journals in various ways, including our free <a href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/sharedit" target="_blank">SharedIt content-sharing initiative</a>, which provides authors and subscribers with shareable links to view-only versions of published papers.”</p><p>We also get a chance to talk with <a href="http://maithraraghu.com/" target="_blank">Maithra Raghu</a> from the Google Brain team about her work. </p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>On this episode of Talking Machines we take a break from our regular format to talk about the “code review of community culture” that the AI, ML, Stats and Computer Science fields in general need to undergo. 

In a blog post, that was put up shortly after NIPS, researcher Kristian Lum outlined several instances of sexual harassment and abuse of power. In her post she mentioned Brad Carlin and a person who she referred to as S. We learned in reporting done by Bloomberg that S was Steven Scott, who was at Google. 

As of this posing Carlin is under investigation and Scott has left Google after being suspended. 

Today we pause in our regular format to talk about how we, as a community, can change. 

Full disclosure: Neil and Katherine served as press chairs for NIPS 2017. They will hold the same post for ICML 2018 and NIPS 2018 and are working along with the other organizers of these events to effect change around these issues. </itunes:summary>

      <title>AI Safety and The Legacy of Bletchley Park</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In episode four of season two, we talk about some of the major issues in AI safety, (and how they’re not really that different from the questions we ask whenever we create a new tool.) One place you can go for other opinions on AI safety is the Future of Life Institute. We take a listener question about time series and we talk with Nick Patterson of the Broad Institute about everything from ancient DNA to Alan Turing. If you're as excited about AlphaGo playing Lee Sedol at Nick is, you can get details on the match on DeepMind's You Tube channel March 5th through the 15th.]]>

      <title>Real Human Actions and Women in Machine Learning</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In episode one of season two, we celebrate the 10th anniversary of Women in Machine Learning (WiML) with its co-founder (and our guest host for this episode) Hanna Wallach of Microsoft Research. Hanna and Jenn Wortman Vaughan, who also helped to found the event, tell us how about how the 2015 event went. Lillian Lee (Cornell), Raia Hadsell (Google Deepmind), Been Kim (AI2/University of Washington), and Corinna Cortes (Google Research) gave invited talks at the 2015 event. WiML also released a directory of women in machine learning, if you’d like to listed, want to find a collaborator, or are looking for an expert to take part in an event, it’s an excellent resource. Plus, we talk with Jenn Wortman Vaughan, about the research she is doing at Microsoft Research which examines the assumptions we make about how humans actually act and using that to inform thinking about our interactions with computers.  Want to learn more about the talks at WiML 2015? Here are the slides from each speaker. Lillian LeeCorinna CortesRaia Hadsell Been Kim]]>

        <![CDATA[In episode twelve we talk with Andrew Ng, Chief Scientist at Baidu, about how speech recognition is going to explode the way we use mobile devices and his approach to working on the problem. We also discuss why we need to prepare for the economic impacts of machine learning. We’re introduced to Random Features for Large-Scale Kernel Machines, and talk about how using this twist on the Kernel trick can help you dig into big data. Plus, we take a listener question about the size of computing power in machine learning.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[In episode eleven we chat with Neil Lawrence from the University of Sheffield. We talk about the problems of privacy in the age of machine learning, the responsibilities that come with using ML tools and making data more open. We learn about the Markov decision process (and what happens when you use it in the real world and it becomes a partially observable Markov decision process) and take a listener question about finding insights into features in the black boxes of deep learning.]]>

His project, The Automatic Statistician, aims to use machine learning to take raw data and give you statistical reports and natural languages summaries of what trends that data shows. We get really hungry exploring Bayesian Non-parametrics through the stories of the Chinese Restaurant Process and the Indian Buffet Process (but remember, there’s no free lunch).

      <title>Common Sense Problems and Learning about Machine Learning</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[On episode three of Talking Machines we sit down with Kevin Murphy who is currently a research scientist at Google. We talk with him about the work he’s doing there on the Knowledge Vault, his textbook, Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (and its arch nemesis which we won’t link to), and how to learn about machine learning (Metacademy is a great place to start). We tackle a listener question about the dream of a one step solution to strong Artificial Intelligence and if Deep Neural Networks might be it. Plus, Ryan introduces us to a new way of thinking about questions in machine learning from Yoshua Bengio’s Lab at the University of Montreal out lined in their new paper, Identifying and attacking the saddle point problem in high-dimensional non-convex optimization, and Katherine brings up Facebook’s release of open source machine learning tools and we talk about what it might mean. If you want to explore some open source tools for machine learning we also recommend giving these a try:Super big list of ML Open Source Projects! Torch Gaussian Process Machine Learning ToolboxPyMCMalletStanWekaTheanoCaffeSpearmint]]>

      <title>Machine Learning and Magical Thinking</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Today on Talking Machines we hear from Google researcher Ilya Sutskever about his work, how he became interested in machine learning, and why it takes a little bit of magical thinking. We take your questions, and explore where the line between human programming and computer learning actually is. And we sift through some news from the field, Ryan explains the concepts behind one of the best papers  at NIPS this year, A * Sampling, and Katherine brings up an open letter about research priorities and ethical questions that was recently published.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[In the first episode of Talking Machines we meet our hosts, Katherine Gorman (nerd, journalist) and Ryan Adams (nerd, Harvard computer science professor), and explore some of the interviews you'll be able to hear this season. Today we hear some short clips on big issues, we'll get technical, but today is all about introductions.We start with Kevin Murphy of Google talking about his textbook that has become a standard in the field. Then we turn to Hanna Wallach of Microsoft Research NYC and UMass Amherst and hear about the founding of WiML (Women in Machine Learning). Next we discuss academia's relationship with business with Max Welling from the University of Amsterdam, program co-chair of  the 2013 NIPS conference (Neural Information Processing Systems). Finally, we sit down with three pillars of the field Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoff Hinton to hear about where the field has been and where it might be headed. ]]>
