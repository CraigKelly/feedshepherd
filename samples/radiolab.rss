</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/everybodys-got-one/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We all think we know the story of pregnancy. Sperm meets egg, f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ollowed by nine months of nurturing, nesting, and quiet incubation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;But this story isn’t the nursery rhyme we think it is. In a way, it’s a struggle, almost like a tiny war. And right on the front lines of that battle is another major player on the stage of pregnancy that not a single person on the planet would be here without. An entirely &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;new &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;organ: the placenta.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this episode we take you on a journey through the 270-day life of this weird, squishy, gelatinous orb, and discover that it is so much more than an organ. It’s a foreign invader. A piece of meat. A friend and parent. And it’s perhaps the most essential piece in the survival of our kind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;reported by Heather Radke and Becca Bressler, and produced by Becca Bressler and Pat Walters, with help from Matt Kielty and Maria Paz Gutierrez. Additional reporting by Molly Webster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/dutee/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2014, India’s Dutee Chand was a rising female track and field star, crushing national records. But then, that summer, something unexpected happened: she failed a gender test. And was banned from the sport. Before she knew it, Dutee was thrown into the middle of a controversy that started long before her, and continues on today: how to separate males and females in sport. First aired in 2018, Dutee and the story of female athletes in sport are back in the spotlight this week, at the Tokyo Olympics. Join us for an update on Dutee’s second Olympic games, and the continued role testosterone has in shaping who is on the track, and who is off. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/queen-dying/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’ve ever lost someone, or watched a medical drama in the last 15 years, you’ve probably heard of The Five Stages of Grief. They’re sort of the world’s worst consolation prize for loss. But last year, we began wondering… Where did these stages come from in the first place?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Turns out, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elisabeth Kübler-Ross. But the story is much, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;much&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; more complicated than that. T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hose stages of grieving? They actually started as stages of dying. After learning that, producer Rachael Cusick tumbled into a year-long journey through the life and work of the incredibly complicated and misunderstood woman who single-handedly changed the way all of us face dying, and the way we deal with being left behind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Special Note: Our friends over at Death Sex and Money have put together a very special companion to this story, featuring Rachael talking about this story with her grandmother.  Check it out &lt;a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/deathsexmoney/episodes/rachael-cusick-grief-radiolab-death-sex-money"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story wouldn’t have been possible without the folks you heard from in the episode, and the many, many people who touched this story, including: Anne Adams, Andrew Aronson, Audrey Gordon, Barbara Hogenson, Basit Qari, Bill Weese, Bob McGan, Carey Gauzens, Clifford Edwards, Cristina McGinniss, Dorothy Holinger, Frank Ostaseski, Ira Byock, Jamie Munson, Jessica Weisberg, Jillian Tullis, Joanna Treichler, Jonathan Green, Ken Bridbord, Ladybird Morgan, Laurel Braitman, Lawrence Lincoln, Leah Siegel, Liese Groot, Linda Mount, Lyn Frumpkin, Mark Kuczewski, Martha Twaddle, Peter Nevraumont, Rosalie Roder, Sala Hilaire, Stefan Haupt, Stephanie Riley, Stephen Connor, and Tracie Hunte.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to all the folks who shared music for this episode, including:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lisa Stoll, who shared her Alpine horn music with us for this episode. You can hear more of her music &lt;a href="https://www.lisastoll.ch/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cliff Edwards, who shared original music from &lt;a href="https://www.deannaedwards.com/"&gt;Deanna Edwards.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.martinhayes.com/martin-hayes-quartet"&gt;The Martin Hayes Quartet&lt;/a&gt;, who shared the last bit of music you hear in the piece that somehow puts a world of emotion into one beautiful tune.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They’re sort of the world’s worst consolation prize for loss. But last year, we began wondering… Where did these stages come from in the first place?</p>
<p>Turns out, Elisabeth Kübler-Ross. But the story is much, <em>much</em> more complicated than that. Those stages of grieving? They actually started as stages of dying. After learning that, producer Rachael Cusick tumbled into a year-long journey through the life and work of the incredibly complicated and misunderstood woman who single-handedly changed the way all of us face dying, and the way we deal with being left behind.</p>
<p>Special Note: Our friends over at Death Sex and Money have put together a very special companion to this story, featuring Rachael talking about this story with her grandmother.  Check it out <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/deathsexmoney/episodes/rachael-cusick-grief-radiolab-death-sex-money">here.</a></p>

&lt;p&gt;In the past few weeks, most people have probably seen Britney Spears' name or face everywhere. When she stood in front of a judge (virtually) and protested the conservatorship she's been living under for the past 13 years, one harrowing detail in particular stood out. She told the judge, "I was told right now in the conservatorship, I'm not able to get married or have a baby." Today, we look back at an old episode where we explore why it is that hundreds of thousands of people can have their reproductive rights denied...and spoiler: it goes back to Darwin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a law student named Mark Bold came across a Supreme Court decision from the 1920s that allowed for the forced sterilization of people deemed “unfit,” he was shocked to discover that it had never been overturned. His law professors told him the case, Buck v Bell, was nothing to worry about, that the ruling was in a kind of legal limbo and could never be used against people. But he didn’t buy it. In this episode we follow Mark on a journey to one of the darkest consequences of humanity’s attempts to measure the human mind and put people in boxes, following him through history, science fiction and a version of eugenics that’s still very much alive today, and watch as he crusades to restore a dash of moral order to the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vanishing of Harry Pace&lt;/em&gt; was created and produced by Shima Oliaee and Jad Abumrad. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

F&lt;/span&gt;eaturing interviews with Pace's descendants and over forty musicians, historians, writers, and musicologists, all of whom grapple with Pace’s enduring legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was Motown before Motown, FUBU before FUBU: Black Swan Records, the record company founded by Harry Pace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vanishing of Harry Pace&lt;/em&gt; was created and produced by Shima Oliaee and Jad Abumrad. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;Harry Pace founded Black Swan Records exactly 100 years ago. Pace launched the career of Ethel Waters, inadvertently invented the term rock n roll, &lt;span&gt;played an important role in W.C. Handy becoming "Father of the Blues," &lt;/span&gt;inspired &lt;em&gt;Ebony&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Jet&lt;/em&gt; magazines, and &lt;span&gt;helped desegregate &lt;/span&gt;the South Side of Chicago in an epic Supreme Court battle. Then, he disappeared.  The &lt;em&gt;Vanishing of Harry Pace&lt;/em&gt; is a series about the phenomenal but forgotten man who changed the American music scene. It's a story about betrayal, family, hidden identities, and a time like no other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p2"&gt;This series was produced in collaboration with author Kiese Laymon, scholar Imani Perry, screenwriter Cord Jefferson, and WQXR’s Terrance McKnight.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/rhino-hunter/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 2014, Corey Knowlton paid $350,000 for a hunting trip to Namibia to shoot and kill an endangered species.  He’s a professional hunter, who guides hunts all around the world, so going to Africa would be nothing new.  The target on the other hand would be. And so too, he quickly found, would be the attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode, producer Simon Adler follows Corey as he dodges death threats and prepares to pull the trigger.  Along the way we stop to talk with Namibian hunters and government officials, American activists, and someone who's been here before - Kenya’s former Director of Wildlife, Richard Leakey.   All the while, we try to uncover what conservation really means in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reported &amp;amp; produced by Simon Adler with production help from Matthew Kielty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/brown-box/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;You order some stuff on the Internet and it shows up three hours later. How could all the things that need to happen to make that happen happen so fast?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It used to be, when you ordered something on the Internet, you waited a week for it to show up. That was the deal: you didn’t have to get off the couch, but you had to wait. But in the last few years, that’s changed. Now, increasingly, the stuff we buy on the Internet shows up the next day or the same day, sometimes within hours. Free shipping included. Which got us wondering: How is this Internet voodoo possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fleet of robots? Vacuum tubes? Teleportation? Hardly. In this short, reporter &lt;a href="http://gabrielmac.com/"&gt;Gabriel Mac&lt;/a&gt; travels into the belly of the beast that is the Internet retail system, and what he finds takes his breath away and makes him weak in the knees (in the worst way). Producer Pat Walters and &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/authors/411-brad-stone"&gt;Brad Stone, author of &lt;em&gt;The Everything Store&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a book about Amazon.com, assist.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/deep-cuts/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, Lulu and Latif talk about some of their favorite episodes from Radiolab’s past that hold new power today.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lulu points to an episode from 2008: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Imagine that you're a composer. Imagine getting the commission to write a song that will allow family members to face the death of a loved one. Well, composer &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bangonacan.org/about_us/david_lang"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;David Lang&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; had to do just that when a hospital in Garches, France, asked him to write music for their morgue, or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/lastgoodbye.shtml"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Salle Des Departs.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; What do you do? This piece was produced by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.strangemusic.com/JGonzales.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jocelyn Gonzales&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And Latif talks about an episode Jad made in 2009. Here’s how we described it back then:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jad--a brand new father--wonders what's going on inside the head of his baby Amil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;(And don't worry, you don't need kids to enjoy this podcast.) The questions here are big: what is it like to be so brand new to the world? None of us have memories from this time, so how could we possibly ever know? Is it just chaos? Or, is there something more, some understanding from the very beginning? Jad found a development psychologist named &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.charlesfernyhough.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Charles Fernyhough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; to explore some of his questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Support Radiolab by becoming a member today at&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pledge3.wnyc.org/donate/radiolab-it/onestep/?utm_source=wnyc&amp;amp;utm_medium=radiolab-redirect&amp;amp;utm_campaign=pledge&amp;amp;utm_content=show-notes" target="_blank" title="Pledge"&gt;Radiolab.org/donate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/septendecennial-sing-along/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Every 17 years, a deafening sex orchestra hits the East Coast -- billions and billions of cicadas crawl out of the ground, sing their hearts out, then mate and die. In this short, Jad and Robert talk to a man who gets inside that noise to dissect its meaning and musical components.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While most of us hear a wall of white noise, squeaks, and squawks....David Rothenberg hears a symphony. He's trained his ear to listen for the music of animals, and he's always looking for chances to join in, with everything from lonely birds to giant whales to swarming cicadas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this podcast, David explains his urge to connect and sing along, and helps break down the mysterious life cycle and mating rituals of the periodical cicadas into something we can all relate to.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/what-holmes/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Love it or hate it, the freedom to say obnoxious and subversive things is the quintessence of what makes America America. But our say-almost-anything approach to free speech is actually relatively recent, and you can trace it back to one guy: a Supreme Court justice named Oliver Wendell Holmes. Even weirder, you can trace it back to one seemingly ordinary 8-month period in Holmes’s life when he seems to have done a logical U-turn on what should be say-able.  Why he changed his mind during those 8 months is one of the greatest mysteries in the history of the Supreme Court.  (Spoiler: the answer involves anarchists, a house of truth, and a cry for help from a dear friend.)  Join us as we investigate why he changed his mind, how that made the country change its mind, and whether it’s now time to change our minds again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He had lymphoma, and the disease plus his drugs weakened his immune system, making him particularly susceptible to the virus. He wasn’t too bad off, considering, and was sent home. That was Day 1. This is the story of what the doctors witnessed, over the course of his illness: the evolution of covid-19 inside his body.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/facebooks-supreme-court/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, the perennial thorn in Facebook’s side has been content moderation. That is, deciding what you and I are allowed to post on the site and what we’re not. Missteps by Facebook in this area have fueled everything from a genocide in Myanmar to viral disinformation surrounding politics and the coronavirus. However, just this past year, conceding their failings, Facebook shifted its approach.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/smile-my-ass/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Candid Camera is one of the most original – and one of the most mischievous – TV shows of all time.  Admirers hailed its creator Allen Funt as a poet of the everyday. Critics denounced him as a Peeping Tom.  Funt sought to capture people at their most unguarded, their most spontaneous, their most natural.  And he did. But as the show succeeded, it started to change the way we thought not only of reality television, but also of reality itself.  Looking back at the show now, a half century later, it’s hard NOT to see so many of our preoccupations – privacy, propriety, publicity, authenticity – through a funhouse mirror, darkly.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/more-money-less-problems/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Back in March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was just beginning and the shelter-in-place orders brought the economy to a screeching halt, a quirky-but-clever idea to save the economy made its way up to some of the highest levels of government. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib proposed an ambitious relief &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://tlaib.house.gov/sites/tlaib.house.gov/files/Automatic%20Boost%20to%20Communities%20Act%20.pdf"&gt;&lt;span&gt;bill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to keep the country’s metaphorical lights on: recurring payments to people to help them stay afloat during the crisis. And the way Congress would pay for it? By minting two platinum $1 trillion coins. (You read that right). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this episode, we take a jaunt through the evolution of our currency, from the gold-backed bills of the 19th century, to the most powerful computer at the Federal Reserve. And we chase an idea that torpedoes what we thought was a fundamental law of economics. Can we &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;actually&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; just print more money? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Horrible, difficult, and at times strikingly beautiful, those photos raise some questions: Who should see them, who gets to decide who should see them, and what can pictures like that do, to those of us far away from the horrors of war and those of us who are all too close to it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/note-radiolab-team/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the past few weeks, there have been a lot of conversations about the tolerance of harassment and bad behavior in our industry and in particular of a person who worked on our show five years ago, Andy Mills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Radiolab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; team wants to say to the people who were hurt, to anyone who has ever felt unwelcome at our show, and to the industry we helped shape: we are listening. We hate that this happened and we apologize to those we failed. At the time, show leadership initiated a response from WNYC to address Andy’s behavior, but it didn’t happen fast enough and it didn’t do enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We can’t change the past, but we can promise you that we are all holding this show, and each other, accountable for making sure that no person has to experience anything like that again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We believe the best journalism demands an open, inclusive process and the widest possible range of perspectives and experiences. As individuals, we promise to put our full hearts to finding and nurturing stories that embrace that range of perspectives and experiences. Listeners: We hope that you’ll hear this commitment in our work ahead, and that you will let us know if you do not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And to our fellow journalists: We love making this show, and we love the community of radio and podcast producers who make it possible for us to exist. Nineteen people work here right now. But over the past 19 years, hundreds of you have contributed stories, ideas, questions, criticism, notes or your ears as listeners. We are grateful to you.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

And as our staff tried to figure out what to do for our last episode of 2020, co-host Latif Nasser thought, what if we stare straight into the darkness … and make a damn Christmas special about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Latif begins with a story about Santa, and a back-room deal he made with the Trump administration to jump to the front of the vaccine line, a tale that travels from an absurd quid-pro-quo to a deep question: who really is an essential worker? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From there, we take a whistle-stop tour through the numbers that scientists say you need to know as you wind your way (or preferably, don’t wind your way) through our COVID-infested world. Producer Sarah Qari brings us her version of the Christmas classic nobody ever dreamt they’d want to hear: The Twelve Numbers of COVID.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can check out Martin Bazant’s COVID “calculator” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://indoor-covid-safety.herokuapp.com/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In the 18th century, two feuding Frenchmen inspired a one-sentence law that helped launch American human rights litigation into the 20th century. The Alien Tort Statute allowed a Paraguayan woman to find justice for a terrible crime committed in her homeland. But as America reached further and further out into the world, the court was forced to confront the contradictions in our country’s ideology: sympathy vs. sovereignty. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court heard arguments in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jesner v. Arab Bank&lt;/em&gt;, a case that could reshape the way America responds to human rights abuses abroad. Does the A.T.S. secure human rights or is it a dangerous overreach?&lt;/p&gt;

And while our current effort to develop a covid-19 vaccine involves thousands of people working around the clock, the mumps vaccine was developed almost exclusively by one person: Maurice Hilleman. Hilleman cranked out more than 40 other vaccines over the course of his career, including 8 of the 14 routinely given to children. He arguably saved more lives than any other single person. And through his work, Hilleman embodied the instincts, drive, and guts it takes to marshall the human body’s defenses against a disease.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/bloc-party/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 1996 election, Bill Clinton had a problem. The women who came out in droves for him in ‘92, split their vote in the ‘94 midterms, handing over control of the House and the Senate to the Republican Party. As his team stared ahead at his re-election bid, they knew they had to win those women back. So, after a major polling effort to determine who exactly their undecided ladies were, Clinton turned his focus toward the most important swing vote in the election: the soccer moms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The soccer mom ushered in a new era of political campaigning, an era of slicing and dicing the electorate, engineering the (predominately white) voting bloc characters that campaigns have chased after. Security Moms. Nascar Dads. Joe Six Pack. Walmart Moms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But what about everyone else? What about the surprisingly swingable corners of this country without a soccer mom in sight?  Inspired by this &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thinglink.com/scene/810170295397646337?buttonSource=viewLimits"&gt;&lt;span&gt;exceedingly cool interactive map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from Politico, we set out on a mission to make an audio-map of our own. We asked pollsters, reporters and political operatives in swing states: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;what slice of your population is up for grabs? A slice that no one talks about? In this episode, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;we crawl inside the places that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;might hold our country’s future in its hands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, all the while asking: are these slices even real? Are there people inside them that might swing this election? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode was reported and produced by Becca Bressler, Tobin Low, Sarah Qari, Tracie Hunte, Pat Walters and Matt Kielty, with help from Jonny Moens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/how-win-friends-and-influence-baboons/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Baboon troops. We all know they’re hierarchical. There’s the big brutish alpha male who rules with a hairy iron fist, and then there’s everybody else. Which is what Meg Crofoot thought too, before she used GPS collars to track the movements of a troop of baboons for a whole month. What she and her team learned from this data gave them a whole new understanding of baboon troop dynamics, and, moment to moment, who really has the power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-stringify-type="bold"&gt;With the recent passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, there's been a lot of debate about how much power the Supreme Court should&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-stringify-type="bold"&gt; re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-stringify-type="bold"&gt;ally&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-stringify-type="bold"&gt; have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of the Supreme Court justices as all-powerful guardians of the constitution, issuing momentous rulings from on high. They seem at once powerful, and unknowable; all lacy collars and black robes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they haven’t always been so, you know, supreme. On this episode of&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;More Perfect&lt;/em&gt;, we go all the way back to the case that, in a lot of ways, is the beginning of the court we know today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Also: we listen back to a mnemonic device (and song) that we created back in 2016 to help people remember the names of the justices. Listen, create a new one, and share with us!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Producer Sarah Qari joins Parker to dig into the legal background, which takes her all the way up to the Supreme Court... and then all the way back down to on-duty officers themselves.</p>
<p><em>This episode contains strong language and graphic violence.</em></p>
<p><em>Reported and produced by B.A. Parker and Sarah Qari, and produced by Matt Kielty and Pat Walters.</em></p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; This is the story of how Ginsburg, as a young &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;lawyer at the ACLU, convinced an all-male Supreme Court to take discrimination against women seriously - using a case on discrimination against men. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/bringing-gamma-back/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, we return to the lab of neuroscientist Li-Huei Tsai, which brought us one of our favorite stories from four years ago - about the power of flashing lights on an Alzheimer’s-addled (mouse) brain. In this update, Li-Huei tells us about her team’s latest research, which now includes flashing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and ways in which light and sound together might retrieve lost memories. &lt;/span&gt;This new science is not a cure, and is far from a treatment, but it’s a finding so … simple, you won’t be able to shake it. Come join us for a lab visit, where we’ll meet some mice, stare at some light, and come face-to-face with the mystery of memory. We can promise you: by the end, you’ll never think the same way about Christmas lights again. Or jingle bells.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This update was reported by Molly Webster, and &lt;em&gt;produced by Rachael Cusick. &lt;/em&gt;The original episode was produced by Annie McEwen, Matt Kielty, and Molly Webster, with help from Simon Adler. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to Ed Boyden, Cognito Therapeutics, Brad Dickerson, Karen Duff, Zaven Khachaturian, Michael Lutz, Kevin M. Spencer, and Peter Uhlhaas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molly's note about the image:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those neon green things in the image are microglia, the brain’s immune cells, or, as we describe them in our episode, the janitor cells of the brain. Straight from MIT’s research files, this image shows microglia who have gotten light stimulation therapy (one can only hope in the flicker room). You can see their many, super-long tentacles, which would be used to feel out anything that didn’t belong in the brain. And then they’d eat it!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In this update, Li-Huei tells us about her team’s latest research, which now includes flashing <em>sound</em>, and ways in which light and sound together might retrieve lost memories. This new science is not a cure, and is far from a treatment, but it’s a finding so … simple, you won’t be able to shake it. Come join us for a lab visit, where we’ll meet some mice, stare at some light, and come face-to-face with the mystery of memory. We can promise you: by the end, you’ll never think the same way about Christmas lights again. Or jingle bells.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/lebanon-usa/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a story of a road trip. After a particularly traumatic Valentine's Day, Fadi Boukaram was surfing google maps and noticed that there was a town called Lebanon... in Oregon. Being Lebanese himself, he wondered, how many Lebanons exist in the US? The answer: 47. Thus began his journey to visit them all and find an America he'd never expected, and the homeland he'd been searching for all along. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;was made in collaboration with Kerning Cultures, a podcast that tells stories from the Middle East and North Africa.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The original "Lebanon USA" story was reported by Alex Atack with editorial support from Bella Ibrahim, Dana Ballout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Zeina Dowidar, and Hebah Fisher. Original sound design by Alex Atack. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new update of the story was produced and reported by Shima Oliaee. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We had original music by Thomas Koner and Jad Atoui.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Note: In an earlier version of this episode, we inaccurately described a grain elevator. We have updated the audio to reflect the correction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to donate to Beirut at this time, we have links here (from NYT):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.supportlrc.app/donate/"&gt;Lebanese Red Cross&lt;/a&gt; dispatches every ambulance from North Lebanon, Bekaa, and South Lebanon to Beirut to treat the wounded and help in search-and-rescue operations. You can make a &lt;a href="https://www.supportlrc.app/donate/donate.html"&gt;contribution here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Nations’ &lt;a href="https://www.wfp.org/"&gt;World Food Program&lt;/a&gt; provides food to people displaced or made homeless after the blast. Lebanon imports nearly 85% of its food, and the port of Beirut, the epicenter of the explosion, played a central role in that supply chain. With the port now severely damaged, food prices are likely to be beyond the reach of many. &lt;a href="https://secure.wfpusa.org/donate/urgent-support-emergency-humanitarian-response-lebanon?ms=2008_UNR_LebanonEmergency_NYT_WEB"&gt;You can donate here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NGO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HI_UnitedStates/status/1291039281037926400"&gt;Humanity and Inclusion&lt;/a&gt; has 100 workers in Lebanon, including physical therapists, psychologists and social workers. They are focusing on post-surgical therapy in Beirut following the explosion. You can make a &lt;a href="https://www.hi-us.org/beirut_explosion"&gt;contribution here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/"&gt;International Medical Corps&lt;/a&gt; is deploying medical units and will provide mental health care to those affected in Lebanon. The humanitarian aid organization also provides health services to Syrian refugees in Lebanon, and vulnerable Lebanese. You can &lt;a href="https://give.internationalmedicalcorps.org/page/65328/donate/1?ea.tracking.id=DP~LB21~DPHPL2108"&gt;donate here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.impactlebanon.org/initiatives/disaster-relief-after-explosion-in-beirut?event=false"&gt;Impact Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit organization, has set up a &lt;a href="https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/lebanon-relief?utm_term=PYp7gXzyD"&gt;crowdfunding campaign&lt;/a&gt; to help organizations on the ground, and is helping to share information about people still missing after the explosion. The group had raised over $3 million as of Wednesday and donated the first $100,000 to the Lebanese Red Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health care organization &lt;a href="https://www.projecthope.org/explosion-in-beirut/"&gt;Project HOPE&lt;/a&gt; is bringing medical supplies and protective gear to Beirut and assisting the authorities on the ground. A donation page is &lt;a href="https://secure.projecthope.org/site/SPageNavigator/2020_02_Main_lightboxupdate.html?autologin=true&amp;amp;mfc_pref=T&amp;amp;s_subsrc=rd1&amp;amp;utm_source=fundraising&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=evergreen"&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 300,000 people in Beirut were displaced from their homes by the explosion. &lt;a href="https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/impact-lebanon"&gt;Baytna Baytak&lt;/a&gt;, a charity that provided free housing to health care workers during the coronavirus pandemic, is now raising funds with Impact Lebanon to shelter those who have been displaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those in Beirut, here is &lt;a href="https://www.daleelthawra.com/category/urgent-needs/"&gt;a list of urgent blood needs&lt;/a&gt;. Several social media accounts have also been set up to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/locatevictimsbeirut/"&gt;help locate victims&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/wubi-effect/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When we think of China today, we think of a technological superpower. From &lt;span&gt;Huawei&lt;/span&gt; and 5G to TikTok and viral social media, China is stride for stride with the United States in the world of computing. However, China’s technological renaissance almost didn’t happen. And for one very basic reason: The Chinese language, with its 70,000 plus characters, couldn’t fit on a keyboard. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we tell the story of Professor Wang Yongmin, a hard headed computer programmer who solved this puzzle and laid the foundation for the China we know today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode was reported and produced by Simon Adler with reporting assistance from &lt;a href="https://yang-yang.space/"&gt;Yang Yang&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, with an eye on the upcoming election, we take a look back: at two pieces from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;More Perfect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; Season 3 about Constitutional amendments that determine who gets to vote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Former &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Radiolab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; producer Julia Longoria takes us to Washington, D.C. The capital is at the heart of our democracy, but it’s not a state, and it wasn’t until the 23rd Amendment that its people got the right to vote for president. But that still left DC without full representation in Congress; D.C. sends a "non-voting delegate" to the House. Julia profiles that delegate, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, and her unique approach to fighting for power in a virtually powerless role.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Second, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Radiolab&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; producer Sarah Qari looks at a current fight to lower the US voting age to 16 that harkens back to the fight for the 26th Amendment in the 1960s. Eighteen-year-olds at the time argued that if they were old enough to be drafted to fight in the War, they were old enough to have a voice in our democracy. But what about today, when even younger Americans are finding themselves at the center of national political debates? Does it mean we should lower the voting age even further?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/baby-blue-blood-drive/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Horseshoe crabs are not much to look at.  But beneath their unassuming catcher’s-mitt shell, they harbor a half-billion-year-old secret: a superpower that helped them outlive the dinosaurs and survive all the Earth’s mass extinctions.  And what is that secret superpower? Their blood. Their baby blue blood.  And it’s so miraculous that for decades, it hasn’t just been saving their butts, it’s been saving ours too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But that all might be about to change.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Follow us as we follow these ancient critters - from a raunchy beach orgy to a marine blood drive to the most secluded waterslide - and learn a thing or two from them about how much we depend on nature and how much it depends on us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2008 Facebook began writing a document. It was a constitution of sorts, laying out what could and what couldn’t be posted on the site. Back then, the rules were simple, outlawing nudity and gore. Today, they’re anything but. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you define hate speech? Where’s the line between a joke and an attack? How much butt is too much butt? Facebook has answered these questions. And from these answers they’ve written a rulebook that all 2.2 billion of us are expected to follow. Today, we explore that rulebook. We dive into its details and untangle its logic. All the while wondering what does this mean for the future of free speech?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode was reported by Simon Adler with help from Tracie Hunte and was produced by Simon Adler with help from Bethel Habte.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Covid has disrupted the most basic routines of our days and nights. But in the middle of a conversation about how to fight the virus, we find a place &lt;span&gt;impervious to&lt;/span&gt; the stalled plans and frenetic demands of the outside world. It’s a very different kind of front line, where urgent work means moving slow, and time is marked out in tiny pre-planned steps. Then, on a walk through the woods, we consider how the tempo of our lives affects our minds and discover how the beats of biology shape our bodies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode was produced with help from Molly Webster and Tracie Hunte.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/david-and-dominique_radiolab/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;David Gebel and Dominique Crisden have a couple of things in common: they both live in New York, they’re both gay, and they’re both HIV-positive. But David is in his 60s, and has been living with the disease since moving to New York in the ‘80s. Dominique, on the other hand, is only in his early 30s. From our friends at WNYC's “Nancy”, this episode features a very special conversation between David and Dominique about the similarities and differences in their experiences living with HIV.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/cataclysm-sentence/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One day in 1961, the famous physicist Richard Feynman stepped in front of a Caltech lecture hall and posed this question to a group of undergraduate students: “If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence was passed on to the next generation of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words?” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-stringify-type="paragraph-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, Feynman had an answer to his own question - a good one. But his question got the entire team at Radiolab wondering, what did his sentence leave out? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-stringify-type="paragraph-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So we posed Feynman’s cataclysm question to some of our favorite writers, artists, historians, futurists - all kinds of great thinkers. We asked them, “What’s the one sentence&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em data-stringify-type="italic"&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;would want to pass on to the next generation that would contain the most information in the fewest words?” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-stringify-type="paragraph-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What came back was an explosive collage of what it means to be alive right here and now, and what we want to say before we go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/dispatch-3-shared-immunity/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;More than a million people have caught Covid-19, and tens of thousands have died. But thousands more have survived and recovered. A week or so ago (aka, what feels like ten years in corona time) producer Molly Webster learned that many of those survivors possess a kind of superpower: antibodies trained to fight the virus. Not only that, they might be able to pass this power on to the people who are sick with corona, and still in the fight. Today we have the story of an experimental treatment that’s popping up all over the country: convalescent plasma transfusion, a century-old procedure that some say may become one of our best weapons against this devastating, new disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have recovered from Covid-19&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and want to donate plasma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, national and local donation registries are gearing up to collect blood. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To sign up with the American Red Cross, a national organization that works in local communities, head &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://redcrossblood.org"&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To find &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;out more about the The National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project, which we spoke about in our episode, including information on clinical trials or plasma donation projects in your community, go &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ccpp19.org/index.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;And if you are in the greater New York City area, and want to donate convalescent plasma, head over to the New York Blood Center &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nybloodcenter.org/donate-blood/covid-19-and-blood-donation-copy/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;to sign up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Or, register with specific NYC hospitals &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nybloodcenter.org/news/articles/new-york-blood-center-collect-first-blood-plasma-donations-recovered-covid-19-patients-treat-severe-cases/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are sick with Covid-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and are interested in participating in a clinical trial, or are looking for a plasma donor match, check in with your local hospital, university, or blood center for more; you can also find more information on trials at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.trialsitenews.com/the-national-covid-19-convalescent-plasma-project/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And lastly, Tatiana Prowell’s tweet that tipped us off is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tmprowell/status/1242995804786302984?s=21"&gt; &lt;span&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode was reported by Molly Webster and produced by Pat Walters. Special thanks to Drs. Evan Bloch and Tim Byun, as well as the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But thousands more have survived and recovered. A week or so ago (aka, what feels like ten years in corona time) producer Molly Webster learned that many of those survivors possess a kind of superpower: antibodies trained to fight the virus. Not only that, they might be able to pass this power on to the people who are sick with corona, and still in the fight. Today we have the story of an experimental treatment that’s popping up all over the country: convalescent plasma transfusion, a century-old procedure that some say may become one of our best weapons against this devastating, new disease.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you have recovered from Covid-19 and want to donate plasma, national and local donation registries are gearing up to collect blood. </p>
<p>To sign up with the American Red Cross, a national organization that works in local communities, head <a href="http://redcrossblood.org">here</a>. </p>
<p>To find out more about the The National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project, which we spoke about in our episode, including information on clinical trials or plasma donation projects in your community, go <a href="https://ccpp19.org/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p> And if you are in the greater New York City area, and want to donate convalescent plasma, head over to the New York Blood Center <a href="https://nybloodcenter.org/donate-blood/covid-19-and-blood-donation-copy/">to sign up</a>.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Radiolab’s Latif Nasser always believed his name was unique, singular, completely his own. Until one day when he makes a bizarre and shocking discovery. He shares his name with another man: Abdul Latif Nasser, detainee 244 at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. government paints a terrifying picture of The Other Latif as Al-Qaeda’s top explosives expert, and one of the most important advisors to Osama bin Laden. Nasser’s lawyer claims that he was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and that he was never even in Al-Qaeda. This clash leads Radiolab’s Latif into a years-long investigation, picking apart evidence, attempting to separate fact from fiction, and trying to uncover what this man actually did or didn’t do. Along the way, Radiolab’s Latif reflects on American values and his own religious past, and wonders how his namesake, a fellow nerdy, suburban Muslim kid, may have gone down such a strikingly different path.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 6: Washington, D.C.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite being cleared for transfer back to his family in Morocco in 2016, Abdul Latif Nasser remains stuck at Guantanamo Bay. Why? Latif talks to some of the civil servants actually responsible for Abdul Latif’s transfer and they tell him a dramatic story of what went on behind the scenes at some of the highest levels of government.  It’s a &lt;span&gt;surprisingly &lt;/span&gt;riveting story of paperwork, where what’s at stake is not only the fate of one man, but also the soul of America.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode was produced by Sarah Qari, Annie McEwen, Suzie Lechtenberg, and Latif Nasser, and reported by Sarah Qari and Latif Nasser.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 5: Cuba-ish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Latif heads to Guantanamo Bay to try to speak to his namesake.  Before he gets there, he attempts to answer a seemingly simple question: why Cuba? Why in the world did the United States pick this sleepy military base in the Caribbean to house “the worst of the worst”?  He tours the “legal equivalent of outer space,” and against all odds, manages to see his doppelgänger… maybe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Radiolab’s Latif Nasser always believed his name was unique, singular, completely his own. Until one day when he makes a bizarre and shocking discovery. He shares his name with another man: Abdul Latif Nasser, detainee 244 at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. government paints a terrifying picture of The Other Latif as Al-Qaeda’s top explosives expert, and one of the most important advisors to Osama bin Laden. Nasser’s lawyer claims that he was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and that he was never even in Al-Qaeda. This clash leads Radiolab’s Latif into a years-long investigation, picking apart evidence, attempting to separate fact from fiction, and trying to uncover what this man actually did or didn’t do. Along the way, Radiolab’s Latif reflects on American values and his own religious past, and wonders how his namesake, a fellow nerdy, suburban Muslim kid, may have gone down such a strikingly different path.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Episode 5: Cuba-ish</p>
<p>Latif heads to Guantanamo Bay to try to speak to his namesake.  Before he gets there, he attempts to answer a seemingly simple question: why Cuba? Why in the world did the United States pick this sleepy military base in the Caribbean to house “the worst of the worst”?  He tours the “legal equivalent of outer space,” and against all odds, manages to see his doppelgänger… maybe.</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 4: Afghanistan &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Latif investigates the mystery around Abdul Latif’s classified time in Afghanistan.

The episode ends with a bombshell jailhouse interview with Abdul Latif, the most reliable evidence yet of what was going on in this man’s mind in the months after 9/11.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Until one day when he makes a bizarre and shocking discovery. He shares his name with another man: Abdul Latif Nasser, detainee 244 at Guantanamo Bay.

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 3: Sudan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Latif turns his focus to Sudan, where his namesake spent time working on a sunflower farm. What could be suspicious about that?  Latif scrutinizes the evidence to try to discover whether - as Abdul Latif’s lawyer insists - it was just an innocent clerical job, or - as the government alleges - it was where he decided to become an extremist fighter.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><em>Radiolab’s</em> Latif Nasser always believed his name was unique, singular, completely his own. Until one day when he makes a bizarre and shocking discovery. He shares his name with another man: Abdul Latif Nasser, detainee 244 at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. government paints a terrifying picture of The Other Latif as Al-Qaeda’s top explosives expert, and one of the most important advisors to Osama bin Laden. Nasser’s lawyer claims that he was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and that he was never even in Al-Qaeda. This clash leads <em>Radiolab</em>’s Latif into a years-long investigation, picking apart evidence, attempting to separate fact from fiction, and trying to uncover what this man actually did or didn’t do. Along the way, <em>Radiolab</em>’s Latif reflects on American values and his own religious past, and wonders how his namesake, a fellow nerdy, suburban Muslim kid, may have gone down such a strikingly different path.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Episode 3: Sudan</p>
<p>Latif turns his focus to Sudan, where his namesake spent time working on a sunflower farm. What could be suspicious about that?  Latif scrutinizes the evidence to try to discover whether - as Abdul Latif’s lawyer insists - it was just an innocent clerical job, or - as the government alleges - it was where he decided to become an extremist fighter.  </p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 2: Morocco&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Latif travels to Abdul Latif’s hometown of Casablanca, Morocco, to try and find out: was he radicalized? And if so, how? Latif begins by visiting the man’s family, but the family’s reaction to him gets complicated as Latif digs for the truth. He finds out surprising information on a political group Abdul Latif joined in his youth, his alleged onramp to extremism. Tensions escalate when Latif realizes he’s being tailed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 1: My Namesake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We hear the evidence against Abdul Latif Nasser -- at least the evidence that has been leaked or declassified -- and we meet Shelby Sullivan-Bennis, his attorney, who contests more or less every government claim against him. Sullivan-Bennis walks us through the excruciating process that came close to releasing Abdul Latif Nasser in the waning days of the Obama administration, but fell apart at the last minute. He is now technically a free man -- he was cleared for transfer home in 2016 -- yet he remains stuck at Guantanamo Bay, thanks in part to a Presidential Tweet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p><span>We hear the evidence against Abdul Latif Nasser -- at least the evidence that has been leaked or declassified -- and we meet Shelby Sullivan-Bennis, his attorney, who contests more or less every government claim against him. Sullivan-Bennis walks us through the excruciating process that came close to releasing Abdul Latif Nasser in the waning days of the Obama administration, but fell apart at the last minute. He is now technically a free man -- he was cleared for transfer home in 2016 -- yet he remains stuck at Guantanamo Bay, thanks in part to a Presidential Tweet.</span></p>

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/60-words/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This hour we pull apart one sentence, written in the hours after September 11th, 2001, that has led to the longest war in U.S. history. We examine how just 60 words of legal language have blurred the line between war and peace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last weekend President Trump authorized a strike that killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Iraq. The news had us thinking about an episode we produced in 2014. We pulled apart one sentence, written in the hours after September 11th, 2001, that has led to the longest war in U.S. history. We examine how just 60 words of legal language have blurred the line between war and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the hours after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a lawyer sat down in front of a computer and started writing a legal justification for taking action against those responsible. The language that he drafted and that President George W. Bush signed into law - called the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) -  has at its heart one single sentence, 60 words long. Over the last decade, those 60 words have become the legal foundation for the "war on terror."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this collaboration with BuzzFeed, reporter Gregory Johnsen tells us the story of how this has come to be one of the most important, confusing, troubling sentences of the last two decades. We go into the meetings that took place in the chaotic days just after 9/11, speak with Congresswoman Barbara Lee and former Congressman Ron Dellums about the vote on the AUMF. We hear from former White House and State Department lawyers John Bellinger &amp;amp; Harold Koh. We learn how this legal language unleashed Guantanamo, Navy Seal raids and drone strikes. And we speak with journalist Daniel Klaidman, legal expert Benjamin Wittes and Virginia Senator Tim Kaine about how these words came to be interpreted, and what they mean for the future of war and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we check back in with Wittes, to see how the AUMF has trickled into the 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;

Oddly enough, this question completely stumped European scientists for thousands of years. And even today, the more we learn about the comings and goings of the animals, the deeper the mystery seems to get. We visit a Bavarian farm with an 11 year old, follow warblers and wildebeests around the world, and get a totally new kind of view of the pulsing flow of animals across the globe.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We visit a Bavarian farm with an 11 year old, follow warblers and wildebeests around the world, and get a totally new kind of view of the pulsing flow of animals across the globe.  </p>

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/breaking-bongo/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deep fake videos have the potential to make it impossible to sort fact from fiction. And some have argued that this blackhole of doubt will eventually send truth itself into a death spiral. But a series of recent events in the small African nation of Gabon suggest it's already happening. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, we follow a ragtag group of freedom fighters as they troll Gabon’s president - Ali Bongo - from afar. Using tweets, videos and the uncertainty they can carry, these insurgents test the limits of using truth to create political change and, confusingly, force us to ask: Can fake news be used for good?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/breaking-news/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, we're re-releasing an old episode a&lt;span&gt;bout how hard it is getting to decipher fact from fiction. Because &lt;span&gt;next week, we’ll be putting out a story showing what happens when certain reality-altering tools get released into the wild. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Adler takes us down a technological rabbit hole of strangely contorted faces and words made out of thin air. And a wonderland full of computer scientists, journalists, and digital detectives forces us to rethink even the things we see with our very own eyes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and by the way, we decided to put the dark secrets we learned into action, and unleash &lt;a href="http://www.futureoffakenews.com"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reported by Simon Adler. Produced by Simon Adler and Annie McEwen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to everyone on the University of Southern California team who helped out with the facial manipulation: Kyle Olszewski, Koki Nagano, Ronald Yu, Yi Zhou, Jaewoo Seo, Shunsuke Saito, and Hao Li.

In this episode of Radiolab, we showcase the first of Jad's special series,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/dolly-partons-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dolly Parton's America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In this intensely divided moment, one of the few things everyone still seems to agree on is Dolly Parton—but why? That simple question leads to a deeply personal, historical, and musical rethinking of one of America’s great icons. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We begin with a simple question: How did the queen of the boob joke become a feminist icon? Helen Morales, author of “Pilgrimage to Dollywood,” gave us a stern directive – look at the lyrics! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So we dive into &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dolly’s discography, starting with the early period of what Dolly calls “sad ass songs” to find remarkably prescient words of female pain, slut-shaming, domestic violence, and women being locked away in asylums by cheating husbands. We explore how Dolly took the centuries-old tradition of the Appalachian “murder ballad”—an oral tradition of men singing songs about brutally killing women—and flipped the script, singing from the woman’s point of view. And as her career progresses, the songs expand beyond the pain to tell tales of leaving abuse behind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How can such pro-woman lyrics come from someone who despises the word feminism? Dolly explains.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Also they can survive outside of water for hours and live for up to 80 years. But this slippery snake of the sea harbors an even deeper mystery, one that has tormented the minds of Aristotle and Sigmund Freud and apparently the entire country of Italy: Where do they come from?

He brought us stories about the Morse Code, the draft lottery, and then he hit us with a brand new episode about a bull on trial, that bounces off a story we did pretty recently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/radiolab-right-be-forgotten/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In an online world, that story about you lives forever. The tipsy photograph of you at the college football game? It’s up there. That news article about the political rally you were marching at? It’s up there. A DUI? That’s there, too. But what if ... it wasn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Cleveland, Ohio, a group of journalists are trying out an experiment that has the potential to turn things upside down: they are unpublishing content they’ve already published. Photographs, names, entire articles. Every month or so, they get together to decide what content stays, and what content goes. On today’s episode, reporter Molly Webster goes inside the room where the decisions are being made, listening case-by-case as editors decide who, or what, gets to be deleted. It’s a story about time and memory; mistakes and second chances; and society as we know it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode was reported by Molly Webster, and produced by Molly Webster and Bethel Habte. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But what if ... it wasn’t.</p>
<p>In Cleveland, Ohio, a group of journalists are trying out an experiment that has the potential to turn things upside down: they are unpublishing content they’ve already published. Photographs, names, entire articles. Every month or so, they get together to decide what content stays, and what content goes. On today’s episode, reporter Molly Webster goes inside the room where the decisions are being made, listening case-by-case as editors decide who, or what, gets to be deleted. It’s a story about time and memory; mistakes and second chances; and society as we know it.</p>

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/radiolab-more-perfect-cruel-and-unusual/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;On the inaugural episode of&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;More Perfect&lt;/em&gt;, we explore three little words embedded in the 8th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution: “cruel and unusual.” America has long wrestled with this concept in the context of our strongest punishment, the death penalty. A majority of “we the people” (&lt;a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/1606/death-penalty.aspx"&gt;61 percent&lt;/a&gt;, to be exact) are in favor of having it, but inside the Supreme Court, opinions have evolved over time in surprising ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And outside of the court, the debate drove one woman in the UK to take on the U.S. death penalty system from Europe. It also caused states to resuscitate old methods used for executing prisoners on death row. And perhaps more than anything, it forced a conversation on what constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/worlds-smartest-animal/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This episode begins with a rant. This rant, in particular, comes from Dan Engber - a science writer who loves animals but despises animal intelligence research. Dan told us that so much of the way we study animals involves tests that we think show a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;human&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; is smart ... not the animals we intend to study. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dan’s rant got us thinking: What &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; the smartest animal in the world? And if we threw out our human intelligence rubric, is there a fair way to figure it out?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Obviously, there is. And it’s a live game show, judged by Jad, Robert … and a dog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last episode of G, Radiolab’s miniseries on intelligence, we’re sharing that game show with you. It was recorded as a live show back in May 2019 at the Greene Space in New York City. We invited two science writers, Dan Engber and Laurel Braitman, and two comedians, Tracy Clayton and Jordan Mendoza, to compete against one another to find the world’s smartest animal. What resulted were a series of funny, delightful stories about unexpectedly smart animals and a shift in the way we think about intelligence across all the animals - including us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the video of our live event &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/thegreenespace/videos/whats-the-smartest-animal-in-the-world-radiolab-is-live-from-the-greene-space-at/1680681042075725/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/g-relative-genius/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Albert Einstein asked that when he died, his body be cremated and his ashes be scattered in a secret location. He didn’t want his grave, or his body, becoming a shrine to his genius. When he passed away in the early morning hours of April, 18, 1955, his family knew his wishes. There was only one problem: the pathologist who did the autopsy had different plans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the third episode of “G”, Radiolab’s miniseries on intelligence, we go on one of the strangest scavenger hunts for genius the world has ever seen. We follow Einstein’s stolen brain from that Princeton autopsy table, to a cider box in Wichita, Kansas, to labs all across the country. And eventually, beyond the brain itself entirely. All the while wondering, where exactly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; the genius of a man who changed the way we view the world? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The lawsuit, Larry P v Riles, ended with a ban on IQ tests for all Black students in the state of California, a ban that’s still in place today. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, we meet the families in California dealing with that ban forty years later. Families the ban was designed to protect, but who now say it discriminates against their children. How much have IQ tests changed since the 70s? And can they be used for good? We talk to the people responsible for designing the most widely used modern IQ test, and along the way, we find out that at the very same moment the IQ test was being put on trial in California, on the other side of the country, it was being used to solve one of the biggest public health problems of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/confirm-nor-deny/</link><description>&lt;p&gt; How a sunken nuclear submarine, a crazy billionaire, and a mechanical claw gave birth to a phrase that has hounded journalists and lawyers for 40 years and embodies the tension between the public’s desire for transparency and the government’s need to keep secrets.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether it comes from government spokespeople or celebrity publicists, the phrase “can neither confirm nor deny” is the perfect non-denial denial. It’s such a perfect deflection that it seems like it’s been around forever, but reporter &lt;a href="http://www.juliabarton.com"&gt;Julia Barton&lt;/a&gt; takes us back to the 1970s and the surprising origin story of what’s now known as a “Glomar Response.” With help from David Sharp and Walt Logan, we tell the story of a clandestine CIA operation to lift a sunken Soviet submarine from the ocean floor and the dilemma they faced when the world found out about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 40 years since that operation, the Glomar Response has become boilerplate language from an array of government agencies. With help from ProPublica editor Jeff Larson and NPR’s Dina Temple-Raston, we explore the implications of this ultimate information dodge. ACLU lawyer Jameel Jaffer explains how it stymies oversight, and we learn that, even 40 years later, governmental secrecy can be emotionally painful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After listening to the story ... &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;After 40 years, many of the details of Project Azorian are only now coming to light. The US government’s default position has been to keep as much of it classified as possible. It took three years for retired CIA employee David Sharp to get permission &lt;a href="http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/shacia.html"&gt;to publish his account&lt;/a&gt; of Project Azorian. And FOIA played an indirect role in that, as Cold War historians got the CIA to release, in redacted form, &lt;a href="http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb305/"&gt;an internal history of the mission&lt;/a&gt;. After that and a threat of legal action, Sharp was finally able to publish his manuscript in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;We mentioned conspiracy theories that have swirled around Project Azorian filling the void where official silence has reigned. One of them is promulgated in the 2005 book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Red-Star-Rogue-Submarines-Nuclear/dp/1416527338"&gt;“Red Star Rogue” by Kenneth Sewell and Clint Richmond.&lt;/a&gt; They posit that the K-129 was taken over by rogue Stalinist KGB agents in order to start a nuclear conflict. But the conflict was to be between the US and China, as, according to the authors, the sub had powers to disguise its sonic signature as a Chinese Navy vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;This book is the basis of the 2013 drama &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1922685/"&gt;“Phantom,”&lt;/a&gt; which features Ed Harris and David Duchovny as Soviet military officers who sip vodka in a very un-Russian way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;Russian Naval historians, &lt;a href="http://www.northfleet.ru/"&gt;like Nikolai Cherkashin&lt;/a&gt;, are not only insulted by this take on the cause of the K-129’s demise, they say the true cause is much easier to pinpoint: They say an American vessel, possibly the USS Swordfish, &lt;a href="http://english.pravda.ru/news/russia/10-09-2007/96959-sunken_submarine-0/"&gt;collided with the Soviet submarine.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite the fact that the US government has turned over many documents about Project Azorian and what it found to the Russian government, many in the Russian Navy stand by their theory that it was far too easy for the US to locate the K-129 on the bottom of the Pacific, given the technology of the time. According to these theories, Project Azorian was nothing more than an elaborate cover-up disguised as... an elaborate cover-up. We can neither confirm nor deny that we exactly understand how that would have worked in practice or execution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt;But for our money, there’s probably no stranger and more telling document from this time &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFWMo7aHDRo&amp;amp;noredirect=1"&gt;than a video of the funeral at sea for Soviet sailors&lt;/a&gt; ostensibly recovered by the US during Project Azorian. Audio of the service starts at 1:25 in this post. Eulogies and rites are performed in both English and Russian (albeit with an American accent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s one of the more solemn moments of the Cold War, and one that the Glomar Response helped keep a secret for a very long time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/dinopocalypse-redux/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using high-powered ballistics experiments, fancy computer algorithms, and good old-fashioned ancient geology, scientists have woven together a theory about the extinction of the dinosaurs that is so precise, so hot, so &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;instantaneous&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, as to seem unimaginable. Today, we bring you this story, first published on Radiolab in 2013, plus an update: a spot on planet Earth, newly discovered, that - if it holds true - has the potential to tell us about the first &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;hours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; after the dinos died.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During World War II, something happened that nobody ever talks about. This is a tale of mysterious balloons, cowboy sheriffs, and young children caught up in the winds of war. And silence, the terror of silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporters Peter Lang-Stanton and Nick Farago tell us the story of a seemingly ridiculous, almost whimsical series of attacks on the US between November of 1944 and May of 1945. With the help of writer Ross Coen, geologist Elisa Bergslien, and professor Mike Sweeney, we uncover a national secret that led to tragedy in a sleepy logging town in south central Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Check out p&lt;span&gt;ictures of the ghostly balloons &lt;a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/pictures-fu-go"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Then again, they said, she wasn’t a exactly an immigrant either. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And they said that the US territory of Puerto Rico, Isabel’s home, was “foreign to the United States in a domestic sense.” Since then, the US has cleared up at least some of the confusion about US territories and the status of people born in them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But, more than a hundred years later, there is still a US territory that has been left in limbo: American Samoa. It is the only place on earth that is US soil, but people who are born there are not automatically US citizens. When we visit American Samoa, we discover that there are some pretty surprising reasons why many American Samoans prefer it that way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/whom-cowbell-tolls/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;When Nancy Holten was 8 years old her mom put her in a moving van. She fell asleep, woke up in Switzerland, and she's been there ever since. Nancy is big into animal rights, crystals, and various forms of natural and holistic healing. She’s also a viral sensation: the Dutch woman apparently so annoying, her Swiss town denied her citizenship. In this episode we go to the little village of Gipf-Oberfrick to meet Nancy, talk with the town, and ask the question: what does it mean and what does it take to belong to a place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode was reported by Kelly Prime and was produced by Kelly Prime and Annie McEwen. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/radiolab-loops/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our lives are filled with loops that hurt us, heal us, make us laugh, and, sometimes, leave us wanting more. This hour, Radiolab revisits the strange things that emerge when something happens, then happens again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and… well, again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this episode of Radiolab, Jad and Robert try to explain an inexplicable comedy act, listen to a loop that literally dies in your ear, and they learn about a loop that sent a shudder up the collective spine of mathematicians everywhere. Finally, they talk to a woman who got to watch herself think the thought that she was watching herself think the thought that she was watching herself think the thought that ... you get the point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p class="p1">In this episode of Radiolab, Jad and Robert try to explain an inexplicable comedy act, listen to a loop that literally dies in your ear, and they learn about a loop that sent a shudder up the collective spine of mathematicians everywhere. Finally, they talk to a woman who got to watch herself think the thought that she was watching herself think the thought that she was watching herself think the thought that ... you get the point.</p>

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/radiolab-clockwork-miracle/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As legend goes, in 1562, King Philip II needed a miracle. So he commissioned one from a highly-skilled clockmaker. In this short, a king's deal with God leads to an intricate mechanical creation, and Jad heads to the Smithsonian to investigate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the 17-year-old crown prince of Spain, Don Carlos, fell down a set of stairs in 1562, he threw his whole country into a state of uncertainty about the future. Especially his father, King Philip II, who despite being the most powerful man in the world, was helpless in the face of his heir's terrible head wound. When none of the leading remedies of the day--bleeding, blistering, purging, or drilling--helped, the king enlisted the help of a relic...the corpse of a local holy man who had died 100 years earlier.

A word we need when we bump into someone on the street, or break someone’s heart. In our increasingly disconnected secular world, “sorry” has been stretched and twisted, and in some cases weaponized. But it’s also one of the only ways we have to piece together a sense of shared values and beliefs. Through today's sea of sorry-not-sorries, empty apologies, and just straight up non-apologies, we wonder what it looks like to make amends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/tweak-vote/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Democracy is on the ropes.  In the United States and abroad, citizens of democracies are feeling increasingly alienated, disaffected, and powerless.  Some are even asking themselves a question that feels almost too dangerous to say out loud: is democracy fundamentally broken?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today on Radiolab, just a day before the American midterm elections, we ask a different question: how do we fix it?  We scrutinize one proposed tweak to the way we vote that could make politics in this country more representative, more moderate, and most shocking of all, more civil.  Could this one surprisingly do-able mathematical fix really turn political campaigning from a rude bloodsport to a campfire singalong? And even if we could do that, would we want to?&lt;/p&gt;

Most of these cases have involved unequivocal breaches of consent, some of which have been criminal. But what have also emerged are conversations surrounding more difficult situations to parse &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ones that exist in a much grayer space. When we started our own reporting through this gray zone, we stumbled into a challenging conversation that we can’t stop thinking about. In this second episode of ‘In the No’, radio-maker Kaitlin Prest joins us for a conversation with Hanna Stotland, an educational consultant who specializes in crisis management. Her clients include students who have been expelled from school for sexual misconduct. In the aftermath, Hanna helps them reapply to school. While Hanna shares some of her more nuanced and confusing cases, we wrestle with questions of culpability, generational divides, and the utility of fear in changing our culture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advisory: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode contains some graphic language and descriptions of very sensitive sexual situations, including discussions of sexual assault, consent and accountability, which may be very difficult for people to listen to. Visit The National Sexual Assault Hotline at online.rainn.org for resources and support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/no-part-1/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In 2017, radio-maker Kaitlin Prest released a mini-series called "No" about her personal struggle to understand and communicate about sexual consent. That show, which dives into the experience, moment by moment, of navigating sexual intimacy, struck a chord with many of us. It's gorgeous, deeply personal, and incredibly thoughtful. And it seemed to presage a much larger conversation that is happening all around us in this moment. And so we decided to embark, with Kaitlin, on our own exploration of this topic. Over the next three episodes, we'll wander into rooms full of college students, hear from academics and activists, and sit in on classes about BDSM. But to start things off, we are going to share with you the story that started it all. Today, meet Kaitlin (if you haven't already). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In The No Part 1 is a collaboration with Kaitlin Prest. It was produced with help from Becca Bressler and Shima Oliaee. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The "No" series, from The Heart was created by writer/director Kaitlin Prest, editors Sharon Mashihi and Mitra Kaboli, assistant producer Ariel Hahn and associate producer Phoebe Wang, associate sound designer Shani Aviram. Special thanks to actor Tommy Schell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p1"&gt;We decided to shake things up at the show so we threw our staff a curveball, Walter Matthau-style. In two weeks time we told our producers to pitch, report, and produce stories about breaking news….or bears. What emerged was a sort of love letter for our honey-loving friends and a discovery that they embody so much more than we could have imagined: a town’s symbol for hope, a celebrity, a foe, and a clue to future ways we’ll deal with our changing environment. &lt;/p&gt;

To figure it all out we go back to the earliest versions of life, and we revisit an earlier version of Radiolab.

It was a constitution of sorts, laying out what could and what couldn’t be posted on the site. Back then, the rules were simple, outlawing nudity and gore. Today, they’re anything but. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you define hate speech? Where’s the line between a joke and an attack? How much butt is too much butt? Facebook has answered these questions. And from these answers they’ve written a rulebook that all 2.2 billion of us are expected to follow. Today, we explore that rulebook. We dive into its details and untangle its logic.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/bad-show/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;With all of the black-and-white moralizing in our world today, we decided to bring back an old show about the little bit of bad that's in all of us...and the little bit of really, &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;bad that's in some of us.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruelty, violence, badness... in this episode we begin with a chilling statistic: 91% of men, and 84% of women, have fantasized about killing someone. We take a look at one particular fantasy lurking behind these numbers, and wonder what this shadow world might tell us about ourselves and our neighbors. Then, we reconsider what Stanley Milgram's famous experiment really revealed about human nature (it's both better and worse than we thought). Next, we meet a man who scrambles our notions of good and evil: chemist Fritz Haber, who won a Nobel Prize in 1918...around the same time officials in the US were calling him a war criminal. And we end with the story of a man who chased one of the most prolific serial killers in US history, then got a chance to ask him the question that had haunted him for years: why?&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/sex-ed/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If there’s one thing Gonads taught us, it’s just how complicated human reproduction is. All the things we thought we knew about biology and sex determination are up for debate in a way that feels both daunting and full of potential. At the same time, we're at a moment where we’re wrestling with how to approach conversations around sex, consent, and boundaries, at a time that may be more divisive than ever. So host Molly Webster thought: what if we took on sex ed, and tried to tackle questions from listeners, youth, reddit (oh boy), and staff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;But instead of approaching these questions the way your high school health teacher might’ve (or government teacher, who knows), Molly invited a cast of storytellers, educators, artists, and comedians to grapple with sex ed in unexpected and thoughtful ways. To help us think about how we can change the conversation. In this episode, an edited down version of a Gonads Live show, Molly's team takes a crack at responding to the intimate questions you asked when you were younger but probably never got a straight answer to. Featuring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Do You Talk About Condoms Without Condom Demonstrations?&lt;/strong&gt; Sanford Johnson. Wanna see how to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06kT9yfj7QE"&gt;put on a sock&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Are Periods?&lt;/strong&gt; Sindha Agha and Gul Agha. Check out Sindha's photography &lt;a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/gonads-presents-sindha-agha/?token=c1522cc189aba26b95e7ead97eb15588&amp;amp;content_type_id=26&amp;amp;object_id=871232&amp;amp;_=e09f8a73"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Anything Off-Limits?&lt;/strong&gt; Ericka Hart, Dalia Mahgoub, and Jonathan Zimmerman &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Do We Do This Anyway? And Other Queries from Fifth Graders&lt;/strong&gt; Jo Firestone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Sex Ed" is an edited* recording of a live event hosted by Radiolab at the Skirball Center in New York City on May 16, 2018. Radiolab Team Gonads is Molly Webster, Pat Walters, and Rachael Cusick, with Jad Abumrad. Live music, including the sex ed questions, and the Gonads theme song, were written, performed, and produced by Majel Connery and Alex Overington. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One more thing! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Over the past few months, Radiolab has been collecting sex ed book suggestions from listeners and staff, about the books that helped them understand the birds and the bees.&lt;/p&gt;

Name, place of birth, photo ID -- the usual. But one question on the application stopped Dana in their tracks: male or female? Dana, technically, wasn’t either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;In this episode, we follow the story of Dana Zzyym, Navy veteran and activist, which starts long before they scribble the word "intersex” on their passport application.

&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We originally posted this episode in 2015, and it inspired producer Molly Webster to take a deep dive into the wild and mysterious world of human reproduction. Starting next week, she’ll be taking over the Radiolab podcast feed for a month to present a series of mind-bending stories that make us rethink the ways we make more of us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You know the drill - all it takes is one sperm, one egg, and blammo - you got yourself a baby. Right? Well, in this episode, conception takes on a new form - it’s the sperm and the egg, plus: two wombs, four countries, and money. Lots of money. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, this is the story of an Israeli couple, two guys, who go to another continent to get themselves a baby - three, in fact - by hiring surrogates to carry the children for them. As we follow them on their journey, an earth shaking revelation shifts our focus from them, to the surrogate mothers. Unfolding in real time, as countries around the world consider bans on surrogacy, this episode looks at a relationship that manages to feel deeply affecting, and deeply uncomfortable, all at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birthstory is a collaboration with the brilliant radio show and podcast Israel Story, created to tell stories for, and about, Israel. &lt;a href="https://israelstory.org/en/episodes/"&gt;Go check ‘em out! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audio Extra:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tal and Amir had a chance to meet each surrogate once - just after the deliveries, after all the paperwork was sorted out, and before any one left Nepal. As Amir says, they wanted to say "a big thank you." These meetings between intended parents, surrogate, and new babies are a traditional part of the surrogacy process in India and Nepal, and we heard reports from the surrogates that they also look forward to them. These moments do not stigmatize, reveal the identity of, or endanger the surrogates. Tal and Amir provided the audio for this web extra.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/unraveling-bolero/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This week, we're throwing it back to an old favorite: a story about obsession, creativity, and a strange symmetry between a biologist and a composer that revolves around one famously repetitive piece of music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anne Adams was a brilliant biologist. But when her son Alex was in a bad car accident, she decided to stay home to help him recover. And then, rather suddenly, she decided to quit science altogether and become a full-time artist. After that, her husband &lt;span&gt;Robert Adams&lt;/span&gt; tells us, she just painted and painted and painted.

&lt;p&gt;At some point, Anne became obsessed with Maurice Ravel's famous composition and decided to put an elaborate visual rendition of the song to canvas. She called it "Unraveling Bolero." But at the time, she had no idea that both she and Ravel would themselves unravel shortly after their experiences with this odd piece of music. &lt;span&gt;Arbie Orenstein&lt;/span&gt; tells us what happened to Ravel after he wrote "Bolero," and neurologist &lt;span&gt;Bruce Miller&lt;/span&gt; helps us understand how, for both Anne and Ravel, "Bolero" might have been the first symptom of a deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/dark-side-earth/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Astronauts at the International Space Station can make one request to talk to an earthling of their choice. For some reason, Astronaut Mark Vande Hei chose us. A couple weeks ago, we were able to video chat with Mark and peer over his shoulder through the Cupola, an observatory room in the ISS. Traveling at 17,000 miles an hour, we zoomed from the Rockies to the East Coast in minutes. And from where Mark sits, the total darkness of space isn’t very far away. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to Mark brought us back to 2012, when we spoke to another astronaut, Dave Wolf. When we were putting together our live show &lt;em&gt;In the Dark&lt;/em&gt;, Jad and Robert called up Dave Wolf to ask him if he had any stories about darkness. And boy, did he. Dave told us two stories that  became the finale of our show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; margin: 5px 10px 5px 10px;" src="https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/imagery/photos/sts-86/86p-036.jpg" alt="" width="300"&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; margin: 5px 10px 5px 10px;" src="https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/imagery/photos/sts-86/86p-027.jpg" alt="" width="300"&gt;Back in late 1997, Dave Wolf was on his first spacewalk, to perform work on the Mir (the photo to the right was taken during that mission, courtesy of &lt;a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/sts86/photo/sts-86-photo-36.htm" target="_blank"&gt;NASA.&lt;/a&gt;). Dave wasn't alone -- with him was veteran Russian cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyev. (That's a picture of Dave giving Anatoly a hug on board the Mir, also courtesy of &lt;a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/sts86/photo/sts-86-photo-27.htm" target="_blank"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out in blackness of space, the contrast between light and dark is almost unimaginably extreme -- every 45 minutes, you plunge between absolute darkness on the night-side of Earth, and blazing light as the sun screams into view. Dave and Anatoly were tethered to the spacecraft, traveling 5 miles per second. That's 16 times faster than we travel on Earth's surface as it rotates -- so as they orbited, they experienced 16 nights and 16 days for every Earth day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave's description of his first spacewalk was all we could've asked for, and more. But what happened next ... well, it's just one of those stories that you always hope an astronaut will tell. Dave and Anatoly were ready to call it a job and head back into the Mir when something went wrong with the airlock. They couldn't get it to re-pressurize. In other words, they were locked out. After hours of trying to fix the airlock, they were running out of the resources that kept them alive in their space suits and facing a grisly death. So, they unhooked their tethers, and tried one last desperate move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, they made it through, and Dave went on to perform dozens more spacewalks in the years to come, but he never again experienced anything like those harrowing minutes trying to improvise his way back into the Mir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that terrifying tale, Dave told us about another moment he and Anatoly shared, floating high above Earth, staring out into the universe ... a moment so beautiful, and peaceful, we decided to use the audience recreate it, as best we could, for the final act of our live show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea of what it looks like during the brightness of day, here's another photo taken in 2009 -- more than a decade after the adventure described in our podcast -- this time of astronaut Tom Marshburn (Dave Wolf is with him, out of frame, photo courtesy of &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1425.html" target="_blank"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

For some reason, Astronaut Mark Vande Hei chose us. A couple weeks ago, we were able to video chat with Mark and peer over his shoulder through the Cupola, an observatory room in the ISS. Traveling at 17,000 miles an hour, we zoomed from the Rockies to the East Coast in minutes. And from where Mark sits, the total darkness of space isn’t very far away. </span></p>
<p><span>Talking to Mark brought us back to 2012, when we spoke to another astronaut, Dave Wolf. </span>When we were putting together our live show <em>In the Dark</em>, Jad and Robert called up Dave Wolf to ask him if he had any stories about darkness. And boy, did he. Dave told us two stories that  became the finale of our show.</p>
<p>Back in late 1997, Dave Wolf was on his first spacewalk, to perform work on the Mir. Dave wasn't alone -- with him was veteran Russian cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyev. </p>
<p>Out in blackness of space, the contrast between light and dark is almost unimaginably extreme -- every 45 minutes, you plunge between absolute darkness on the night-side of Earth, and blazing light as the sun screams into view. Dave and Anatoly were tethered to the spacecraft, traveling 5 miles per second. That's 16 times faster than we travel on Earth's surface as it rotates -- so as they orbited, they experienced 16 nights and 16 days for every Earth day.</p>
<p>Dave's description of his first spacewalk was all we could've asked for, and more. But what happened next ... well, it's just one of those stories that you always hope an astronaut will tell. Dave and Anatoly were ready to call it a job and head back into the Mir when something went wrong with the airlock. They couldn't get it to re-pressurize. In other words, they were locked out. After hours of trying to fix the airlock, they were running out of the resources that kept them alive in their space suits and facing a grisly death. So, they unhooked their tethers, and tried one last desperate move.</p>
<p>In the end, they made it through, and Dave went on to perform dozens more spacewalks in the years to come, but he never again experienced anything like those harrowing minutes trying to improvise his way back into the Mir.</p>
<p>After that terrifying tale, Dave told us about another moment he and Anatoly shared, floating high above Earth, staring out into the universe ... a moment so beautiful, and peaceful, we decided to use the audience recreate it, as best we could, for the final act of our live show.</p>

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/border-trilogy-part-3-what-remains/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Border Trilogy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While scouring the Sonoran Desert for objects left behind by migrants crossing into the United States, anthropologist Jason De León happened upon something he didn't expect to get left behind: a human arm, stripped of flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This macabre discovery sent him reeling, needing to know what exactly happened to the body, and how many migrants die that way in the wilderness. In researching border-crosser deaths in the Arizona desert, he noticed something surprising. Sometime in the late-1990s, the number of migrant deaths shot up dramatically and have stayed high since. Jason traced this increase to a Border Patrol policy still in effect, called “Prevention Through Deterrence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over three episodes, Radiolab will investigate this policy, its surprising origins, and the people whose lives were changed forever because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3: What Remains &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third episode in our Border Trilogy follows anthropologist Jason De León after he makes a grisly discovery in Arivaca, Arizona. In the middle of carrying out his pig experiments with his students, Jason finds the body of a 30-year-old female migrant. With the help of the medical examiner and some local humanitarian groups, Jason discovers her identity. Her name was Maricela. Jason then connects with her family, including her brother-in-law, who survived his own harrowing journey through Central America and the Arizona desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the human cost of Prevention Through Deterrence weighing on our minds, we try to parse what drives migrants like Maricela to cross through such deadly terrain, and what, if anything, could deter them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This episode was reported by Latif Nasser and Tracie Hunte and was produced by Matt Kielty and Tracie Hunte. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2: Hold the Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the showdown in court with Bowie High School, Border Patrol brings in a fresh face to head its dysfunctional El Paso Sector: Silvestre Reyes. The first Mexican-American to ever hold the position, Reyes knows something needs to change and has an idea how to do it. One Saturday night at midnight, with the element of surprise on his side, Reyes unveils ... Operation Blockade. It wins widespread support for the Border Patrol in El Paso, but sparks major protests across the Rio Grande. Soon after, he gets a phone call that catapults his little experiment onto the national stage, where it works so well that it diverts migrant crossing patterns along the entire U.S.-Mexico Border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, in the Arizona desert, anthropologist Jason de León realizes that in order to accurately gauge how many migrants die crossing the desert, he must first understand how human bodies decompose in such an extreme environment. He sets up a macabre experiment, and what he finds is more drastic than anything he could have expected.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>This macabre discovery sent him reeling, needing to know what exactly happened to the body, and how many migrants die that way in the wilderness.  In researching border-crosser deaths in the Arizona desert, he noticed something surprising.

<p>Part 2: Hold the Line</p>
<p>After the showdown in court with Bowie High School, Border Patrol brings in a fresh face to head its dysfunctional El Paso Sector: Silvestre Reyes. The first Mexican-American to ever hold the position, Reyes knows something needs to change and has an idea how to do it. One Saturday night at midnight, with the element of surprise on his side, Reyes unveils ... Operation Blockade. It wins widespread support for the Border Patrol in El Paso, but sparks major protests across the Rio Grande. Soon after, he gets a phone call that catapults his little experiment onto the national stage, where it works so well that it diverts migrant crossing patterns along the entire U.S.-Mexico Border.</p>
<p>Years later, in the Arizona desert, anthropologist Jason de León realizes that in order to accurately gauge how many migrants die crossing the desert, he must first understand how human bodies decompose in such an extreme environment. He sets up a macabre experiment, and what he finds is more drastic than anything he could have expected.</p>

<p class="p1"><em>CORRECTION: An earlier version of this piece incorrectly stated that Silvestre Reyes's brother died in a car accident in 1968; it was actually his father who died in the accident.  We also omitted a detail about the 1997 GAO report that we quote, namely that it predicted that as deaths in the mountains and deserts might rise, deaths in other areas might also fall. The audio has been adjusted accordingly.</em></p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1: Hole in the Fence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We begin one afternoon in May 1992, when a student named Albert stumbled in late for history class at Bowie High School in El Paso, Texas. His excuse: Border Patrol. Soon more stories of students getting stopped and harassed by Border Patrol started pouring in. So begins the unlikely story of how a handful of Mexican-American high schoolers in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country stood up to what is today the country’s largest federal law enforcement agency. They had no way of knowing at the time, but what would follow was a chain of events that would drastically change the US-Mexico border. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/rippin-the-rainbow-an-even-newer-one/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;One of our most popular episodes of all time was our &lt;a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/211119-colors/"&gt;Colors episode&lt;/a&gt;, where we introduced you to a sea creature that could see a rainbow far beyond what humans can experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peacock mantis shrimps are as extraordinary as they are strange and boast what may well be the most complicated visual system in the world. They each have 16 photoreceptors compared to our measly three. But recently researchers in Australia put the mantis shrimps’ eyes to the test only to discover that sure, they can SEE lots of colors, but that doesn't mean they can tell them apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, when two colors are close together - like yellow and yellow-y green - they can’t seem to tell them apart at all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MORE ON COLORS: There was a time -- between the flickery black-and-white films of yore and the hi-def color-corrected movies we watch today -- when color was in flux.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/radiolab-presents-more-perfect-gun-show/</link><description>&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The shooting in Parkland, Florida on February 14, 2018, reignited an increasingly familiar debate about guns in this country. Today, we’re re-releasing a &lt;em&gt;More Perfect &lt;/em&gt;episode that aired just after the Las Vegas shooting last year that attempts to make sense of our country’s fraught relationship with the Second Amendment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;For nearly 200 years of our nation’s history, the Second Amendment was an all-but-forgotten rule about the importance of militias. But in the 1960s and 70s, a movement emerged — led by Black Panthers and a recently-repositioned NRA — that insisted owning a firearm was the right of each and every American.

</title><link>http://www.wnycstudios.org/story/ghosts-football-past/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of Super Bowl LII (Go Eagles), we're revisiting an old episode about the surprising history of how the game came to be. It's the end of the 19th century -- the Civil War is over, and the frontier is dead. And young college men are anxious. What great struggle will test their character? Then along comes a new craze: football. A brutally violent game where young men can show a stadium full of fans just what they're made of. Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Penn -- the sons of the most powerful men in the country are literally knocking themselves out to win these gladiatorial battles. And then the most American team of all, with the most to prove, gets in the game and owns it. The Carlisle Indian School, formed in 1879 to assimilate the children and grandchildren of the men who fought the final Plains Wars against the fathers and grandfathers of the Ivy Leaguers, starts challenging the best teams in the country. On the football field, Carlisle had a chance for a fair fight with high stakes -- a chance to earn respect, a chance to be winners, and a chance to go forward in a changing world that was destroying theirs. &lt;/p&gt;
