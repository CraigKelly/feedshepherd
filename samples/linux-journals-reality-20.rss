From SLRs with dual autofocus systems and Translucent Mirror Technology to its NEX mirrorless line-up, Sony has gone down virtually every avenue in digital imaging. Its latest products - the Alpha 7 and Alpha 7R - may be the most exciting products to come out of the Sony labs in some time. The company has managed to create full-frame cameras which are about the same size as the Olympus OM-D E-M1. In other words, the Alpha 7s are much smaller than their full-frame interchangeable lens peers (such as Nikon's D610 and the Canon EOS 6D), an achievement made possible primarily because they're not SLRs.</li><li><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sony-a6400-review" title="Sony a6400 review: Digital Photography Review" rel="nofollow">Sony a6400 review: Digital Photography Review</a> &mdash; Sony's a6400 is a compact 24MP mirrorless interchangeable lens camera with an APS-C sensor that will serve plenty of photographers from family documentarians to pro shooters looking for a lightweight second body. The big news is that it has a new processor based on that used in Sony's sports-shooting flagship a9 which enables 'Real-Time Tracking' autofocus, which is one of the most effective autofocus implementations we've yet seen. It's also among the easiest to use, once you've gotten it set up.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Electro-Voice-RE20-Broadcast-Microphone-Variable-D/dp/B00KCN83V8" title="Amazon.com: Electro-Voice RE20 Broadcast Announcer Microphone with Variable-D: Musical Instruments" rel="nofollow">Amazon.com: Electro-Voice RE20 Broadcast Announcer Microphone with Variable-D: Musical Instruments</a></li><li><a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/accessories/x2u-xlr-usb-interface" title="X2U - Microphone to USB Adapter" rel="nofollow">X2U - Microphone to USB Adapter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/cam-link-4k" title="Cam Link 4K | elgato.com" rel="nofollow">Cam Link 4K | elgato.com</a></li><li><a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light-air" title="Key Light Air | elgato.com" rel="nofollow">Key Light Air | elgato.com</a></li><li><a href="https://www.plex.tv/" title="Watch Free Movies Online Now | Stream Free TV with Plex" rel="nofollow">Watch Free Movies Online Now | Stream Free TV with Plex</a></li><li><a href="https://www.hisense-usa.com/tv-and-audio/televisions/all-tvs/55R6G_4k-uhd-hisense-roku-tv-with-hdr-2020" title="4K UHD Hisense Roku TV with HDR (2020) (55R6G) - Hisense USA" rel="nofollow">4K UHD Hisense Roku TV with HDR (2020) (55R6G) - Hisense USA</a></li><li><a href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/" title="Aeron - Office Chairs - Herman Miller" rel="nofollow">Aeron - Office Chairs - Herman Miller</a></li><li><a href="https://ergify.com/shop-tag/swopper-active-stool/" title="Swopper Active Stool Archives | Ergify" rel="nofollow">Swopper Active Stool Archives | Ergify</a></li><li><a href="https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-ergonomic-office-chairs.html" title="18 Best Ergonomic Office Chairs 2021 | The Strategist" rel="nofollow">18 Best Ergonomic Office Chairs 2021 | The Strategist</a> &mdash; Whether you’re working from home at a DIY desk setup or commuting to an office, you may have begun to feel the strain that sitting for seven or more hours a day can put on a body. If said strain has led you to wonder whether it’s worth investing in a better, more ergonomic office chair, the answer is almost certainly yes, according to experts we spoke to. “Makeshift setups can cause a laundry list of problems, including back, shoulder, and wrist pain,” explains Dr. David Perna of Back and Body Medical. Dr. Marc Agulnick, an orthopedic surgeon based on Long Island who’s affiliated with NYU Winthrop Hospital, agrees: “If you’re sitting for a long period of time in one position that’s not natural, or a bad position from a postural standpoint, over time that’s going to break down your spine.”</li><li><a href="https://arcade1up.com/" title="Arcade1Up | Officially Licensed Arcade Cabinets" rel="nofollow">Arcade1Up | Officially Licensed Arcade Cabinets</a></li></ul>]]>

From SLRs with dual autofocus systems and Translucent Mirror Technology to its NEX mirrorless line-up, Sony has gone down virtually every avenue in digital imaging. Its latest products - the Alpha 7 and Alpha 7R - may be the most exciting products to come out of the Sony labs in some time. The company has managed to create full-frame cameras which are about the same size as the Olympus OM-D E-M1. In other words, the Alpha 7s are much smaller than their full-frame interchangeable lens peers (such as Nikon's D610 and the Canon EOS 6D), an achievement made possible primarily because they're not SLRs.</li><li><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sony-a6400-review" title="Sony a6400 review: Digital Photography Review" rel="nofollow">Sony a6400 review: Digital Photography Review</a> &mdash; Sony's a6400 is a compact 24MP mirrorless interchangeable lens camera with an APS-C sensor that will serve plenty of photographers from family documentarians to pro shooters looking for a lightweight second body. The big news is that it has a new processor based on that used in Sony's sports-shooting flagship a9 which enables 'Real-Time Tracking' autofocus, which is one of the most effective autofocus implementations we've yet seen. It's also among the easiest to use, once you've gotten it set up.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Electro-Voice-RE20-Broadcast-Microphone-Variable-D/dp/B00KCN83V8" title="Amazon.com: Electro-Voice RE20 Broadcast Announcer Microphone with Variable-D: Musical Instruments" rel="nofollow">Amazon.com: Electro-Voice RE20 Broadcast Announcer Microphone with Variable-D: Musical Instruments</a></li><li><a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/accessories/x2u-xlr-usb-interface" title="X2U - Microphone to USB Adapter" rel="nofollow">X2U - Microphone to USB Adapter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/cam-link-4k" title="Cam Link 4K | elgato.com" rel="nofollow">Cam Link 4K | elgato.com</a></li><li><a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light-air" title="Key Light Air | elgato.com" rel="nofollow">Key Light Air | elgato.com</a></li><li><a href="https://www.plex.tv/" title="Watch Free Movies Online Now | Stream Free TV with Plex" rel="nofollow">Watch Free Movies Online Now | Stream Free TV with Plex</a></li><li><a href="https://www.hisense-usa.com/tv-and-audio/televisions/all-tvs/55R6G_4k-uhd-hisense-roku-tv-with-hdr-2020" title="4K UHD Hisense Roku TV with HDR (2020) (55R6G) - Hisense USA" rel="nofollow">4K UHD Hisense Roku TV with HDR (2020) (55R6G) - Hisense USA</a></li><li><a href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/" title="Aeron - Office Chairs - Herman Miller" rel="nofollow">Aeron - Office Chairs - Herman Miller</a></li><li><a href="https://ergify.com/shop-tag/swopper-active-stool/" title="Swopper Active Stool Archives | Ergify" rel="nofollow">Swopper Active Stool Archives | Ergify</a></li><li><a href="https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-ergonomic-office-chairs.html" title="18 Best Ergonomic Office Chairs 2021 | The Strategist" rel="nofollow">18 Best Ergonomic Office Chairs 2021 | The Strategist</a> &mdash; Whether you’re working from home at a DIY desk setup or commuting to an office, you may have begun to feel the strain that sitting for seven or more hours a day can put on a body. If said strain has led you to wonder whether it’s worth investing in a better, more ergonomic office chair, the answer is almost certainly yes, according to experts we spoke to. “Makeshift setups can cause a laundry list of problems, including back, shoulder, and wrist pain,” explains Dr. David Perna of Back and Body Medical. Dr. Marc Agulnick, an orthopedic surgeon based on Long Island who’s affiliated with NYU Winthrop Hospital, agrees: “If you’re sitting for a long period of time in one position that’s not natural, or a bad position from a postural standpoint, over time that’s going to break down your spine.”</li><li><a href="https://arcade1up.com/" title="Arcade1Up | Officially Licensed Arcade Cabinets" rel="nofollow">Arcade1Up | Officially Licensed Arcade Cabinets</a></li></ul>]]>

We hoped Fleets would help more people feel comfortable joining the conversation on Twitter.

Because of this, on August 3, Fleets will no longer be available on Twitter.

Bias can emerge due to many factors, including but not limited to the design of the algorithm or the unintended or unanticipated use or decisions relating to the way data is coded, collected, selected or used to train the algorithm. Algorithmic bias is found across platforms, including but not limited to search engine results and social media platforms, and can have impacts ranging from inadvertent privacy violations to reinforcing social biases of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. The study of algorithmic bias is most concerned with algorithms that reflect "systematic and unfair" discrimination. This bias has only recently been addressed in legal frameworks, such as the 2018 European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. More comprehensive regulation is needed as emerging technologies become increasingly advanced and opaque.</li><li><a href="http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1954643,00.html" title="Face-Detection Cameras: Glitches Spur Charges of Racism - TIME" rel="nofollow">Face-Detection Cameras: Glitches Spur Charges of Racism - TIME</a> &mdash; When Joz Wang and her brother bought their mom a Nikon Coolpix S630 digital camera for Mother's Day last year, they discovered what seemed to be a malfunction.

We hoped Fleets would help more people feel comfortable joining the conversation on Twitter. But, in the time since we introduced Fleets to everyone, we haven’t seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped. Because of this, on August 3, Fleets will no longer be available on Twitter.

Bias can emerge due to many factors, including but not limited to the design of the algorithm or the unintended or unanticipated use or decisions relating to the way data is coded, collected, selected or used to train the algorithm. Algorithmic bias is found across platforms, including but not limited to search engine results and social media platforms, and can have impacts ranging from inadvertent privacy violations to reinforcing social biases of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. The study of algorithmic bias is most concerned with algorithms that reflect "systematic and unfair" discrimination. This bias has only recently been addressed in legal frameworks, such as the 2018 European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. More comprehensive regulation is needed as emerging technologies become increasingly advanced and opaque.</li><li><a href="http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1954643,00.html" title="Face-Detection Cameras: Glitches Spur Charges of Racism - TIME" rel="nofollow">Face-Detection Cameras: Glitches Spur Charges of Racism - TIME</a> &mdash; When Joz Wang and her brother bought their mom a Nikon Coolpix S630 digital camera for Mother's Day last year, they discovered what seemed to be a malfunction. Every time they took a portrait of each other smiling, a message flashed across the screen asking, "Did someone blink?" No one had. "I thought the camera was broken!" Wang, 33, recalls. But when her brother posed with his eyes open so wide that he looked "bug-eyed," the messages stopped.</li><li><a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/meet-the-censored-matt-orfalea" title="Meet the Censored: Matt Orfalea - by Matt Taibbi - TK News by Matt Taibbi" rel="nofollow">Meet the Censored: Matt Orfalea - by Matt Taibbi - TK News by Matt Taibbi</a> &mdash; Yes, the government is helping crack down on text messages and Facebook posts, but not to worry.

He is the original author of the GNU Bash shell, which he announced as a beta in June 1989.[1] He continued as the primary maintainer of bash until at least early 1993.[2][3] Fox also built the first interactive online banking software in the U.S. for Wells Fargo in 1995,[4] and he created an open source election system in 2008.</li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/opinion/open-source-software-hacker-voting.html" title="Opinion | To Protect Voting, Use Open-Source Software - The New York Times" rel="nofollow">Opinion | To Protect Voting, Use Open-Source Software - The New York Times</a> &mdash; Although Russian hackers are reported to have tried to disrupt the November election with attacks on the voting systems of 39 states, the consensus of the intelligence community is that they were probably unsuccessful in their efforts to delete and alter voter data. But another national election is just 15 months away, and the risk that those working on behalf of President Vladimir Putin of Russia could do real damage — and even manage to mark your ballot for you or altering your vote — remains.

Since the debacle of the 2000 election (remember hanging chads?) American election machinery has been improved to reduce the chances of mis-tallying votes, outright fraud and attacks by hackers. These improvements brought with them a new concern: lack of software security. Most voting machines’ software can now be easily hacked. This is in large part because the current voting systems use proprietary software based on Microsoft’s operating system.</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Jay_Sussman" title="Gerald Jay Sussman - Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Gerald Jay Sussman - Wikipedia</a> &mdash; Gerald Jay Sussman (born February 8, 1947) is the Panasonic Professor of Electrical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He received his S.B. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from MIT in 1968 and 1973 respectively. He has been involved in artificial intelligence (AI) research at MIT since 1964. His research has centered on understanding the problem-solving strategies used by scientists and engineers, with the goals of automating parts of the process and formalizing it to provide more effective methods of science and engineering education. Sussman has also worked in computer languages, in computer architecture and in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design.[1]</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" title="Lisp (programming language) - Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Lisp (programming language) - Wikipedia</a> &mdash; Lisp (historically LISP) is a family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation.[3] Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today. Only Fortran is older, by one year.[4][5] Lisp has changed since its early days, and many dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best-known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Racket, Common Lisp, Scheme and Clojure.</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwnie_Awards" title="Pwnie Awards - Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Pwnie Awards - Wikipedia</a> &mdash; The Pwnie Awards recognize both excellence and incompetence in the field of information security. Winners are selected by a committee of security industry professionals from nominations collected from the information security community.[2] The awards are presented yearly at the Black Hat Security Conference.[3]</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell" title="Z shell - Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Z shell - Wikipedia</a> &mdash; The Z shell (Zsh) is a Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a command interpreter for shell scripting. Zsh is an extended Bourne shell with many improvements, including some features of Bash, ksh, and tcsh.</li></ul>]]>

He is the original author of the GNU Bash shell, which he announced as a beta in June 1989.[1] He continued as the primary maintainer of bash until at least early 1993.[2][3] Fox also built the first interactive online banking software in the U.S. for Wells Fargo in 1995,[4] and he created an open source election system in 2008.</li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/opinion/open-source-software-hacker-voting.html" title="Opinion | To Protect Voting, Use Open-Source Software - The New York Times" rel="nofollow">Opinion | To Protect Voting, Use Open-Source Software - The New York Times</a> &mdash; Although Russian hackers are reported to have tried to disrupt the November election with attacks on the voting systems of 39 states, the consensus of the intelligence community is that they were probably unsuccessful in their efforts to delete and alter voter data. But another national election is just 15 months away, and the risk that those working on behalf of President Vladimir Putin of Russia could do real damage — and even manage to mark your ballot for you or altering your vote — remains.

Since the debacle of the 2000 election (remember hanging chads?) American election machinery has been improved to reduce the chances of mis-tallying votes, outright fraud and attacks by hackers. These improvements brought with them a new concern: lack of software security. Most voting machines’ software can now be easily hacked. This is in large part because the current voting systems use proprietary software based on Microsoft’s operating system.</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Jay_Sussman" title="Gerald Jay Sussman - Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Gerald Jay Sussman - Wikipedia</a> &mdash; Gerald Jay Sussman (born February 8, 1947) is the Panasonic Professor of Electrical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He received his S.B. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from MIT in 1968 and 1973 respectively. He has been involved in artificial intelligence (AI) research at MIT since 1964. His research has centered on understanding the problem-solving strategies used by scientists and engineers, with the goals of automating parts of the process and formalizing it to provide more effective methods of science and engineering education. Sussman has also worked in computer languages, in computer architecture and in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design.[1]</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" title="Lisp (programming language) - Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Lisp (programming language) - Wikipedia</a> &mdash; Lisp (historically LISP) is a family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation.[3] Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today. Only Fortran is older, by one year.[4][5] Lisp has changed since its early days, and many dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best-known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Racket, Common Lisp, Scheme and Clojure.</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwnie_Awards" title="Pwnie Awards - Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Pwnie Awards - Wikipedia</a> &mdash; The Pwnie Awards recognize both excellence and incompetence in the field of information security. Winners are selected by a committee of security industry professionals from nominations collected from the information security community.[2] The awards are presented yearly at the Black Hat Security Conference.[3]</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell" title="Z shell - Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">Z shell - Wikipedia</a> &mdash; The Z shell (Zsh) is a Unix shell that can be used as an interactive login shell and as a command interpreter for shell scripting. Zsh is an extended Bourne shell with many improvements, including some features of Bash, ksh, and tcsh.</li></ul>]]>

Although other major browser vendors are likely against this technology and will presumably not be implementing it, given Chrome’s market share this will become a concerning issue, because it largely remove users’ ability to easily opt out of being tracked—particularly true in the case of less-savvy users.

Similarly, the WordPress and Joomla communities are taking similar measures.

They exist within the grey – where enterprise branding joins together with the larcenous to be called “digital intelligence.” Their customer list has included authoritarian regimes in Belarus, Russia, Venezuela, and China; death squads in Bangladesh; military juntas in Myanmar; and those seeking to abuse and oppress in Turkey, UAE, and elsewhere. A few months ago, they announced that they added Signal support to their software.

Their products have often been linked to the persecution of imprisoned journalists and activists around the world, but less has been written about what their software actually does or how it works. Let’s take a closer look. In particular, their software is often associated with bypassing security, so let’s take some time to examine the security of their own software.

</li><li><a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/australia-anti-encryption-law/" title="Australia’s vague anti-encryption law sets a dangerous new precedent - ProtonMail Blog" rel="nofollow">Australia’s vague anti-encryption law sets a dangerous new precedent - ProtonMail Blog</a> &mdash; the Australian government and its Labor partners rammed a shockingly invasive anti-encryption law through Parliament, over the objections of experts, businesses, and civil rights groups.</li><li><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/australia-encryption-law-global-impact/" title="Australia's Encryption-Busting Law Could Impact Global Privacy | WIRED" rel="nofollow">Australia's Encryption-Busting Law Could Impact Global Privacy | WIRED</a> &mdash; Australia has passed a law that would require companies to weaken their encryption, a move that could reverberate globally.
</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem" title="P versus NP problem - Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">P versus NP problem - Wikipedia</a> &mdash; The P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science. It asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified can also be solved quickly.

</li><li><a href="https://puri.sm/posts/data-double-dipping-when-companies-mine-paying-customers/" title="Data Double Dipping: When Companies Mine Paying Customers – Purism" rel="nofollow">Data Double Dipping: When Companies Mine Paying Customers – Purism</a> &mdash; There’s an old snarky saying among privacy advocates: “If you aren’t paying for something, you are the product!” This updated version of “There’s no such thing as a free lunch” arose in the Internet age among the ever-growing list of free services and apps on the Internet funded by collecting and selling your data to advertisers. If large companies like Google and Facebook are any indication, a lot of money can be made with user data and the more data you collect, the more money you can make.</li><li><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/eva_galperin_what_you_need_to_know_about_stalkerware" title="Eva Galperin: What you need to know about stalkerware | TED Talk" rel="nofollow">Eva Galperin: What you need to know about stalkerware | TED Talk</a> &mdash; "Full access to a person's phone is the next best thing to full access to a person's mind," says cybersecurity expert Eva Galperin. In an urgent talk, she describes the emerging danger of stalkerware -- software designed to spy on someone by gaining access to their devices without their knowledge -- and calls on antivirus companies to recognize these programs as malicious in order to discourage abusers and protect victims.</li><li><a href="https://www.reality2cast.com/52" title="Reality 2.0 Episode 52: Fragmentation and Outrage of the Week" rel="nofollow">Reality 2.0 Episode 52: Fragmentation and Outrage of the Week</a> &mdash; Doc Searls and Katherine Druckman talk to Kyle Rankin about fragmentation and software development, the Amazon Halo, and surveilling school children.</li><li><a href="https://thisishowtheytellmetheworldends.com/" title="This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends" rel="nofollow">This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends</a> &mdash; From New York Times cybersecurity reporter Nicole Perlroth, THIS IS HOW THEY TELL ME THE WORLD ENDS is the untold story of the cyber arms trade-the most secretive, invisible, government-backed market on earth-and a terrifying first look at a new kind of global warfare.

They exist within the grey – where enterprise branding joins together with the larcenous to be called “digital intelligence.” Their customer list has included authoritarian regimes in Belarus, Russia, Venezuela, and China; death squads in Bangladesh; military juntas in Myanmar; and those seeking to abuse and oppress in Turkey, UAE, and elsewhere. A few months ago, they announced that they added Signal support to their software.

Their products have often been linked to the persecution of imprisoned journalists and activists around the world, but less has been written about what their software actually does or how it works. Let’s take a closer look. In particular, their software is often associated with bypassing security, so let’s take some time to examine the security of their own software.

</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem" title="P versus NP problem - Wikipedia" rel="nofollow">P versus NP problem - Wikipedia</a> &mdash; The P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science. It asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified can also be solved quickly.

If large companies like Google and Facebook are any indication, a lot of money can be made with user data and the more data you collect, the more money you can make.</li><li><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/eva_galperin_what_you_need_to_know_about_stalkerware" title="Eva Galperin: What you need to know about stalkerware | TED Talk" rel="nofollow">Eva Galperin: What you need to know about stalkerware | TED Talk</a> &mdash; "Full access to a person's phone is the next best thing to full access to a person's mind," says cybersecurity expert Eva Galperin. In an urgent talk, she describes the emerging danger of stalkerware -- software designed to spy on someone by gaining access to their devices without their knowledge -- and calls on antivirus companies to recognize these programs as malicious in order to discourage abusers and protect victims.</li><li><a href="https://www.reality2cast.com/52" title="Reality 2.0 Episode 52: Fragmentation and Outrage of the Week" rel="nofollow">Reality 2.0 Episode 52: Fragmentation and Outrage of the Week</a> &mdash; Doc Searls and Katherine Druckman talk to Kyle Rankin about fragmentation and software development, the Amazon Halo, and surveilling school children.</li><li><a href="https://thisishowtheytellmetheworldends.com/" title="This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends" rel="nofollow">This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends</a> &mdash; From New York Times cybersecurity reporter Nicole Perlroth, THIS IS HOW THEY TELL ME THE WORLD ENDS is the untold story of the cyber arms trade-the most secretive, invisible, government-backed market on earth-and a terrifying first look at a new kind of global warfare.

While SpaceX eventually hopes to have as many as 12,000 satellites in this so-called megaconstellation, the size and scale of the project have flustered astronomers and amateur skywatchers, who fear that the bright, orbiting objects will interfere with observations of the universe. </li><li><a href="https://heavens-above.com/?lat=0&lng=0&loc=Unspecified&alt=0&tz=UCT" title="Heavens-Above" rel="nofollow">Heavens-Above</a> &mdash; Awesome site for space nerds.</li><li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/enriquedans/2021/02/23/how-starlink-is-about-to-disrupt-the-telecommunications-sector/?sh=85c043c659ab" title="How Starlink Is About To Disrupt The Telecommunications Sector" rel="nofollow">How Starlink Is About To Disrupt The Telecommunications Sector</a> &mdash; If the logo doesn’t ring a bell, put it on your radar.

"Security becomes a major issue. Anyone can be hacked. However, the risk is far less when it comes to proprietary software. Due to the nature of open-source software allowing anyone to update the code, the risk of downloading malicious code is much higher. One source referred to using open-source software as “eating from a dirty fork.” When you reach in the drawer for a clean fork, you could be pulling out a dirty utensil.

Katherine (41s):
The concept of fragmentation as it applies to software development. 
Kyle (1m 44s):
[I]f you're an application developer today and you're writing a program, you know, 20 years ago, what you had to do is think about, well, do I want my application to run on windows, Mac, or Linux, or what combination of those? And then depending on your decision, you would pick different frameworks, different languages, maybe, and each individual platform you had, the support basically made you had the fork, the code in many cases.
Kyle (2m 31s):
I mean, depending on what, what graphical libraries you picked, but these days it's way worse. Because with mobile devices, you've added a couple of extra platforms on top of those three. So now it's not just windows, Mac, or Linux, it's also Android or iOS. And so, and then, so what ends up happening is the developer will say, well, do I want to make a mobile application or do I want to make a desktop application? And then they'll start with that standpoint. And they, or they may say, well, I want to do all of the above, but then there's a minimum of like five different platforms. They have to support them. And all of them are often in different languages, you know, different development, methodologies, different frameworks, different tools to test and build all of that stuff.
Kyle (3m 16s):
[W]e decided, well, it makes the most sense to avoid fragmentation and have the same operating system that our laptop runs just instead of sort of making an application, porting an application to the phone, let's just make the existing Linux desktop ecosystem as a whole portable to a small screen
Katherine (10m 1s):
[W]hat's happening now with the new M1 processor the whole idea is that any Mac app can now be, or rather the other way around, any iOS app is now a desktop app, which is interesting because it's sort of the opposite reality.
Katherine (16m 41s):
[I]t's almost ridiculous to me at this point that I can't just plug in my, if, if I were to have a fancy new iPhone, which I don't, but if I did, why shouldn't I just be able to plug it in? You know, it's a powerful device, it has a massive amount of computing power 
Kyle (19m 43s):
If at all, you know, depending on the provider, Google has had huge problems with, you know, all of these third parties that create custom versions of Android and they never update them. So they've had to go through all of these engineering efforts to try to avoid just the fragmentation in the Android market, with all of these custom Androids that are out there.
Katherine (31m 28s):
[T]he Amazon halo wearable device because all of the coverage, even, and maybe even, especially in mainstream press outlets has been so bad. I mean, it's, you know, it's not just privacy advocates or, you know, geeks like us who are going really, who thought this was a good idea. The Washington post, which is as they even pointed out owned by Jeff Bezos is just tearing this thing apart.
Doc (31m 60s):
So the headline Amazon's new health band is the most invasive tech we've ever tested. And then the subhead is even better. It says the halo band asks you to strip down and strap on a microphone. So it can make 3d scans of your body fat and monitor your tone of voice after all that. It still isn't very helpful. 
Katherine (43m 47s):
An article in Gizmodo about schools, us schools, having access to the same technology that federal law enforcement has for breaking into phones. And they use this technology to conduct warrantless searches of student phones.
Katherine (46m 6s):
[I]t knows everything that you're anxious about. It knows everything that you're curious about. It knows, you know, it knows everything. And yet somehow some school districts and in fact judges, apparently because these, these issues have gone to court, find it perfectly acceptable for a school to be able to hack into somebody’s device. So I, I find this really disturbing. I wonder, Kyle, if you could kind of maybe give us some insight about how, how potentially dangerous this is.
Kyle (46m 40s):
I mean, I've, I see this trend over and over again, where what will happen is someone will come up with a new invasive technology and it's sort of like boiling the frog kind of thing where you could not, you know, throw this against everybody. Like everyone would rise up and say, this is not okay. But so what you do instead is you start with people with the least possible agency. You can normally, if you have some sort of invasive privacy invasive tech, the first step is to either sell it for stopping terrorism or maybe pedophiles. And then after, after you get sort of a proof of concept there, then you have to expand. If you're selling a product, you need to expand your user base.
Doc (54m 21s):
Yeah. The weird thing for me is that almost nobody's worked on starting with giving us agency, you know, I mean, we should be able to say, here's privacy. Here's, here's what I've got. You can't see anything. You're not seeing anything we're doing. 
Doc (57m 34s):
That's my message to all of you. We can't do that. And we need to be able to do that, that's why my preference would be for the default to be, you have to default to, I'm not collecting any of your data. Your data is yours. I'm not allowed to do it. I'm only allowed to do it. If you expressly give me informed consent to do it. And then at that point I will do it, but you, but, but if I, if you do nothing, then I can't do it. I can't take any of your data. It's yours. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's one of the more quoted things that I've written in the last few years. 
Katherine (58m 58s):
But I kind of feel like we are in the wild West. That's how I feel like when digitally, when we start talking about things like, you know, schools being allowed to quite literally digitally strip search your children, you know, people should be outraged by that
Kyle (59m 38s):
Well, but that's also because your average parent given the preference, and many of them already do put spyware on their children's phones to track their children, right. Because they want to be able to see everything that their kid did. 
Kyle (1h 0m 18s):
I keep, I keep saying, it's not that people don't care about privacy, as much as they don't understand the implications of what they're giving up, you know? And so I, you know, a lot of parents don't necessarily understand the implications of, of what it normalizes.

<p>Doc (57m 34s):<br>
That&#39;s my message to all of you. We can&#39;t do that. And we need to be able to do that, that&#39;s why my preference would be for the default to be, you have to default to, I&#39;m not collecting any of your data. Your data is yours. I&#39;m not allowed to do it. I&#39;m only allowed to do it. If you expressly give me informed consent to do it. And then at that point I will do it, but you, but, but if I, if you do nothing, then I can&#39;t do it. I can&#39;t take any of your data. It&#39;s yours. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it&#39;s one of the more quoted things that I&#39;ve written in the last few years. </p>

<p>Katherine (58m 58s):<br>
But I kind of feel like we are in the wild West. That&#39;s how I feel like when digitally, when we start talking about things like, you know, schools being allowed to quite literally digitally strip search your children, you know, people should be outraged by that</p>

<p>Kyle (59m 38s):<br>
Well, but that&#39;s also because your average parent given the preference, and many of them already do put spyware on their children&#39;s phones to track their children, right. Because they want to be able to see everything that their kid did. </p>

<p>Kyle (1h 0m 18s):<br>
I keep, I keep saying, it&#39;s not that people don&#39;t care about privacy, as much as they don&#39;t understand the implications of what they&#39;re giving up, you know? And so I, you know, a lot of parents don&#39;t necessarily understand the implications of, of what it normalizes.</p><p>Special Guest: Kyle Rankin.</p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/reality2cast" rel="payment">Support Reality 2.0</a></p><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://puri.sm/posts/preventing-fragmentation-with-the-librem-5/" title="Preventing Fragmentation with the Librem 5 – Purism" rel="nofollow">Preventing Fragmentation with the Librem 5 – Purism</a> &mdash; Fragmentation is a massive problem in computer software development that has only gotten worse with mobile computers. By fragmentation I’m referring to incompatible platforms that require a developer to maintain separate forks of their code. Twenty years ago if you wanted to write software for an end user, you had to decide whether to support Windows, Macs or Linux. Each of those platforms required you to build, test, and maintain different forks of your software.</li><li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/10/amazon-halo-band-review/" title="Amazon’s Halo Band wearable tracks your voice and body fat, but isn’t helpful - The Washington Post" rel="nofollow">Amazon’s Halo Band wearable tracks your voice and body fat, but isn’t helpful - The Washington Post</a> &mdash; The Halo Band asks you to strip down and strap on a microphone so that it can make 3-D scans of your body fat and monitor your tone of voice.

      <description>Doc Searls, Katherine Druckman, Petros Koutoupis, and Kyle Rankin talk Parler and platform lock-in, the concept of data, software, and hardware ownership, and the open source social contract.
Show notes: 
(49s):
“I think the first one, maybe the that's that we could cover is, well, let's see, how do I put this without causing too much controversy? That's just the idea of siloed social, silos of any kind, but in particular social media and perceived censorship as it, as it applies to social media. That's a, that's a hot topic right now.”
(1m 59s):
“Do you not know about parlor? No. Oh, this is going to be a great episode!”
(3m 54s):
“And so, as a result, a lot of people who are concerned about censorship on Twitter and Facebook have moved over there. And, and in particular on the conservative side, just because like with any social network, there's a network effect.”
(5m 11s):
“It also reminds me of the early days of Google plus”
(8m 53s):
“I think we're moving from one moderator to, I mean, This happens on, on Mastodon quite a bit where you will have, because it's so federated and because all of the instances can in theory, talk to each other, sometimes you'll have a falling out because many Mastodon instances are more or less governed by the winds of a sysadmin who decided to spin it up.”
(10m 55s):
“It looks different to everybody. We all have our own, our own feeds are on, you know, our own preferences, our own, you know, whenever it is, I mean, it's, it's, it's shaped shifts for each of us, depending on what we've looked at and who we follow and all the rest of it. And it's by design. So there's no uniform vision to it.”
(11m 35s):
“I think you said it, Catherine did, a lot of people were sort of creeped out by Facebook, but it's only because of read a bunch of stuff about, Hey, you're not private there. And then the movie they watched that movie, you know...now they're scared of Facebook. They're not entirely sure why.”
(12m 34s):
“We don't need platforms for all this stuff. You can do this stuff without platforms.”
(15m 24s):
“So that's an interesting segue into one of the other topics that we've been talking about and that's, it's being owned by platforms instead of the other way around. And I think, you know, we all have in common that we are, we have a bit of a DIY and obviously open source mentality” 
(18m 11s):
“Apple announced a new Big Sur release. And around the time that they announced the update that the update was available. So presumably people were downloading it, et cetera. People started noticing on their Macs that they were having trouble launching programs. They would try to launch an application. And sometimes it would take, you know, a minute after saying to launch before the application showed up on their local machine.”
(23m 15s):
“it really raises the issues of ownership. You know?”
(24m 42s):
“And it sounds like in many cases, you don't, if you have a Mac, you don't necessarily own that” 
(24m 59s):
“I don't know if there are degrees of severity of one's lack of control over your digital products in your life.”
(28m 20s):
“And, you know, and I thought the chance that Google is going to get rid of those is pretty high Google's record of holding onto a service that people don't pay for is pretty lousy.”
(29m 40s):
“You have a bundle of rights. And, and I think that we haven't worked out yet online.”
(32m 29s):
“And this ephemeral service, which is now tied to a tangible thing, that tangible thing, which before would have different rules applied to it, like say a thermostat or whatever it is, where when the, the cloud service goes away, the company goes away.”
(33m 17s):
“For example, like this, this thing that happened this week that we already talked about with Apple, I think a lot of people didn't think about how applications launching was tethered to the cloud in any way”
(33m 48s):
“It's like the, the internet is a network of leashes and, like dog leashes with colors on them.”
(35m 48s):
“And I think it was 1890 and it was about the time they decided the right of privacy was the right to be let alone.”
(36m 52s):
“something that we've talked about many times, and that is open source, open source licensing, open source culture, open source awareness, even.”
(37m 50s):
“And people now start to question, they go, Hey, wait a second. This, this big platform is making a ton of money off of this code that I wrote, but I'm not.”
(39m 25s):
“And does it matter, does it matter what exactly we're talking about? Like, does it matter if I'm talking about contributing to something like Apache or, you know, Linux kernel, or does it matter if we're talking about some sort of web framework or library that, you know, a Facebook, a Twitter, a tic talk is using to make a lot of money, you know, that may, or even a product you just don't like, does it, does it somehow matter? I mean, obviously  from a licensing perspective, it doesn't, but from an ideological perspective, does it matter?”
(41m 18s):
“And what does it even mean to contribute back to the project?”
(42m 18s):
“I think that's where the social contract starts to break down.”
(46m 10s):
“And that's supposed to be a good thing. What you want is to work with the companies that are using your software, and hopefully they will, they will release patches and fixes and improvements to your software. That's the idealized model.”
(48m 19s):
“open source licenses are pretty ubiquitous.”
(48m 33s):
“Well, you're writing code with an IDE that is probably free software. You didn't pay for it under an open-source license maybe on an OS that has similar licensing that you didn't have to work on using other people's libraries that you didn't have to write yourself from scratch all the way down to the OSTP.”

        <![CDATA[<p><em>Doc Searls, Katherine Druckman, Petros Koutoupis, and Kyle Rankin talk Parler and platform lock-in, the concept of data, software, and hardware ownership, and the open source social contract.</em></p>

<p><strong>Show notes:</strong> <br>
(49s):<br>
“I think the first one, maybe the that&#39;s that we could cover is, well, let&#39;s see, how do I put this without causing too much controversy? That&#39;s just the idea of siloed social, silos of any kind, but in particular social media and perceived censorship as it, as it applies to social media. That&#39;s a, that&#39;s a hot topic right now.”</p>

<p>(1m 59s):<br>
“Do you not know about parlor? No. Oh, this is going to be a great episode!”</p>

<p>(3m 54s):<br>
“And so, as a result, a lot of people who are concerned about censorship on Twitter and Facebook have moved over there. And, and in particular on the conservative side, just because like with any social network, there&#39;s a network effect.”</p>

<p>(5m 11s):<br>
“It also reminds me of the early days of Google plus”</p>

<p>(8m 53s):<br>
“I think we&#39;re moving from one moderator to, I mean, This happens on, on Mastodon quite a bit where you will have, because it&#39;s so federated and because all of the instances can in theory, talk to each other, sometimes you&#39;ll have a falling out because many Mastodon instances are more or less governed by the winds of a sysadmin who decided to spin it up.”</p>

<p>(10m 55s):<br>
“It looks different to everybody. We all have our own, our own feeds are on, you know, our own preferences, our own, you know, whenever it is, I mean, it&#39;s, it&#39;s, it&#39;s shaped shifts for each of us, depending on what we&#39;ve looked at and who we follow and all the rest of it. And it&#39;s by design. So there&#39;s no uniform vision to it.”</p>

<p>(11m 35s):<br>
“I think you said it, Catherine did, a lot of people were sort of creeped out by Facebook, but it&#39;s only because of read a bunch of stuff about, Hey, you&#39;re not private there. And then the movie they watched that movie, you know...now they&#39;re scared of Facebook. They&#39;re not entirely sure why.”</p>

<p>(12m 34s):<br>
“We don&#39;t need platforms for all this stuff. You can do this stuff without platforms.”</p>

<p>(15m 24s):<br>
“So that&#39;s an interesting segue into one of the other topics that we&#39;ve been talking about and that&#39;s, it&#39;s being owned by platforms instead of the other way around. And I think, you know, we all have in common that we are, we have a bit of a DIY and obviously open source mentality” </p>

<p>(18m 11s):<br>
“Apple announced a new Big Sur release. And around the time that they announced the update that the update was available. So presumably people were downloading it, et cetera. People started noticing on their Macs that they were having trouble launching programs. They would try to launch an application. And sometimes it would take, you know, a minute after saying to launch before the application showed up on their local machine.”</p>

<p>(23m 15s):<br>
“it really raises the issues of ownership. You know?”</p>

<p>(24m 42s):<br>
“And it sounds like in many cases, you don&#39;t, if you have a Mac, you don&#39;t necessarily own that” </p>

<p>(24m 59s):<br>
“I don&#39;t know if there are degrees of severity of one&#39;s lack of control over your digital products in your life.”</p>

<p>(28m 20s):<br>
“And, you know, and I thought the chance that Google is going to get rid of those is pretty high Google&#39;s record of holding onto a service that people don&#39;t pay for is pretty lousy.”</p>

<p>(29m 40s):<br>
“You have a bundle of rights. And, and I think that we haven&#39;t worked out yet online.”</p>

<p>(32m 29s):<br>
“And this ephemeral service, which is now tied to a tangible thing, that tangible thing, which before would have different rules applied to it, like say a thermostat or whatever it is, where when the, the cloud service goes away, the company goes away.”</p>

<p>(33m 17s):<br>
“For example, like this, this thing that happened this week that we already talked about with Apple, I think a lot of people didn&#39;t think about how applications launching was tethered to the cloud in any way”</p>

<p>(33m 48s):<br>
“It&#39;s like the, the internet is a network of leashes and, like dog leashes with colors on them.”</p>

<p>(35m 48s):<br>
“And I think it was 1890 and it was about the time they decided the right of privacy was the right to be let alone.”</p>

<p>(36m 52s):<br>
“something that we&#39;ve talked about many times, and that is open source, open source licensing, open source culture, open source awareness, even.”</p>

<p>(37m 50s):<br>
“And people now start to question, they go, Hey, wait a second. This, this big platform is making a ton of money off of this code that I wrote, but I&#39;m not.”</p>

<p>(39m 25s):<br>
“And does it matter, does it matter what exactly we&#39;re talking about? Like, does it matter if I&#39;m talking about contributing to something like Apache or, you know, Linux kernel, or does it matter if we&#39;re talking about some sort of web framework or library that, you know, a Facebook, a Twitter, a tic talk is using to make a lot of money, you know, that may, or even a product you just don&#39;t like, does it, does it somehow matter? I mean, obviously  from a licensing perspective, it doesn&#39;t, but from an ideological perspective, does it matter?”</p>

<p>(41m 18s):<br>
“And what does it even mean to contribute back to the project?”</p>

<p>(42m 18s):<br>
“I think that&#39;s where the social contract starts to break down.”</p>

<p>(46m 10s):<br>
“And that&#39;s supposed to be a good thing. What you want is to work with the companies that are using your software, and hopefully they will, they will release patches and fixes and improvements to your software. That&#39;s the idealized model.”</p>

<p>(48m 19s):<br>
“open source licenses are pretty ubiquitous.”</p>

<p>(48m 33s):<br>
“Well, you&#39;re writing code with an IDE that is probably free software. You didn&#39;t pay for it under an open-source license maybe on an OS that has similar licensing that you didn&#39;t have to work on using other people&#39;s libraries that you didn&#39;t have to write yourself from scratch all the way down to the OSTP.”</p>

<p>(49m 16s):<br>
“Well, that&#39;s free software. And so the WordPress people knock on your door and like, Oh, well, and that&#39;s running on Linux. And so Linus is going to show up and what his handout, you know, it, everyone&#39;s sort of, for some reason, people think that, well, you&#39;re sitting on this entire body of work that people have put so much effort for free into to share with everyone else you&#39;re taking the benefit of that.”</p>

<p>(51m 13s):<br>
