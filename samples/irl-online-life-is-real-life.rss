    <title>IRL - Online Life Is Real Life</title>
    <description>Our online life is real life. We walk, talk, work, LOL and even love on the Internet – but we don’t always treat it like real life. Host Manoush Zomorodi explores this disconnect with stories from the wilds of the Web, and gets to the bottom of online issues that affect us all. Whether it’s privacy breaches, closed platforms, hacking, fake news, or cyber bullying, we the people have the power to change the course of the Internet, keeping it ethical, safe, weird, and wonderful for everyone. IRL is an original podcast from Firefox, the tech company backed by Mozilla that believes privacy isn’t a policy. It’s a right.</description>

      <itunes:summary>‘5G’ is a new buzzword floating around every corner of the internet. But what exactly is this hyped-up cellular network, often referred to as the next technological evolution in mobile internet communications? Will it really be 100 times faster than what we have now? What will it make possible that has never been possible before? Who will reap the benefits? And, who will get left behind?

Mike Thelander at Signals Research Group imagines the wild ways 5G might change our lives in the near future. Rhiannon Williams hits the street and takes a new 5G network out for a test drive. Amy France lives in a very rural part of Kansas — she dreams of the day that true, fast internet could come to her farm (but isn’t holding her breath). Larry Irving explains why technology has never been provided equally to everyone, and why he fears 5G will leave too many people out. Shireen Santosham, though, is doing what she can to leverage 5G deployment in order to bridge the digital divide in her city of San Jose. </itunes:summary>

      <title>The Tech Worker Resistance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>There's a movement building within tech. Workers are demanding higher standards from their companies — and because of their unique skills and talent, they have the leverage to get attention. Walkouts and sit-ins. Picket protests and petitions. Shareholder resolutions, and open letters. These are the new tools of tech workers, increasingly emboldened to speak out. And, as they do that, they expose the underbellies of their companies' ethics and values or perceived lack of them.</p>
<p>In this episode of IRL, host Manoush Zomorodi meets with Rebecca Stack-Martinez, an Uber driver fed up with being treated like an extension of the app; <a href="https://twitter.com/supernodal/">Jack Poulson</a>, who left Google over ethical concerns with a secret search engine being built for China; and Rebecca Sheppard, who works at Amazon and pushes for innovation on <a href="https://twitter.com/AMZNforClimate/">climate change</a> from within. EFF Executive Director <a href="https://twitter.com/eff/">Cindy Cohn</a> explains why this movement is happening now, and why it matters for all of us.</p>

      <title>The Internet's Carbon Footprint</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Manoush Zomorodi explores the surprising environmental impact of the internet in this episode of IRL. Because while it’s easy to think of the internet as living only on your screen, energy demand for the internet is indeed powered by massive server farms, running around the clock, all over the world. What exactly is the internet’s carbon footprint? And, what can we do about it?</p>
<p>Music professor <a href="https://twitter.com/kyledevinephd/">Kyle Devine</a> considers the environmental costs of streaming music. Geophysicist and pop scientist <a href="http://twitter.com/geo_miles/">Miles Traer</a> takes his best shot at calculating the carbon footprint of the IRL podcast. Climate journalist <a href="http://twitter.com/tatertatiana/">Tatiana Schlossberg</a> explores the environmental influence we don’t know we have and what the web’s got to do with it. Greenpeace’s <a href="https://twitter.com/garyacook/">Gary Cook</a> explains which tech companies are committed to renewable energy — and which are not. Kris De Decker tries powering his <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">website</a> with a homebrew solar power system. And, Ecosia's <a href="http://twitter.com/treepieter/">Chief Tree Planting Officer Pieter Van Midwoud</a> discusses how his company uses online search to plant trees.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Part of celebrating democracy is questioning what influences it. In this episode of IRL, we look at how the internet influences us, our votes, and our systems of government. Is democracy in trouble? Are democratic elections and the internet incompatible? 

Politico's Mark Scott takes us into Facebook's European Union election war room. Karina Gould, Canada's Minister for Democratic Institutions, explains why they passed a law governing online political ads. The ACLU's Ben Wizner says our online electoral integrity problem goes well beyond a few bad ads. The team at Stop Fake describes a massive problem that Ukraine faces in telling political news fact from fiction, as well as how they're tackling it. And NYU professor Eric Klinenberg explains how a little bit of offline conversation goes a long way to inoculate an electorate against election interference.

      <title>The "Privacy Policy" Policy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Privacy policies: most apps and websites have them, buried away somewhere. These legal documents explain how the company collects, uses, and shares your personal data. But let's be honest, few of us actually read these things, right? And that passive acceptance says a lot about our complicated relationship with online privacy.</p>
<p>In the Season 5 premiere of IRL, host <a href="https://twitter.com/manoushz">Manoush Zomorodi</a> speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/cwarzel">Charlie Warzel</a>, writer-at-large with the New York Times, about our complicated relationship with data and privacy — and the role privacy policies play in keeping things, well, confusing. You'll also hear from Parker and Lila, two young girls who realize how gaming and personal data intersect. <a href="http://missinfogeek.net/">Rowenna Fielding</a>, a data protection expert, walks us through the most efficient ways to understand a privacy policy. Professor <a href="http://lorrie.cranor.org/">Lorrie Cranor</a> explains how these policies have warped our understanding of consent.

      <title>What if Women Built the Internet?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>All the things we love on the internet — from websites that give us information to services that connect us — are made stronger when their creators come with different points of view.

<p><a href="https://www.witchsy.com/">Witchsy</a> founders Kate Dwyer and Penelope Gazin start us off with a story about the stunt they had to pull to get their site launched — and counter the sexist attitudes they fought against along the way. <a href="https://twitter.com/BrendaDardenW">Brenda Darden Wilkerson</a> recalls her life in tech in the 80s and 90s and shares her experience leading <a href="https://anitab.org/">AnitaB.org</a>, an organization striving to get more women hired in tech. <a href="https://twitter.com/CoralineAda">Coraline Ada Ehmke</a> created the <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a>, a voluntary code of conduct being increasingly adopted by the open source community.

      <title>Decentralize It</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Some people believe that decentralization is the inevitable future of the web.

      <title>The Human Costs of Content Moderation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>What, if anything, should be banned from online media? And who should review violent and explicit content, in order to decide if it’s okay for the public? Thousands of people around the world are working long, difficult hours as content moderators in support of sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. They are guided by complex and shifting guidelines, and their work can sometimes lead to psychological trauma. But the practice of content moderation also raises questions about censorship and free expression online.</p>
<p>In this IRL episode, host <a href="https://twitter.com/manoushz/">Manoush Zomorodi</a> talks with a forensic investigator who compares the work she does solving disturbing crimes with the work done by content moderators. We hear the stories of content moderators working in the Philippines, as told by the directors of a new documentary called <a href="http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/films/the-cleaners/">The Cleaners</a>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/silverellen">Ellen Silver</a> from Facebook joins us to outline Facebook's content moderation policies. <a href="https://www.kalevleetaru.com/">Kalev Leetaru</a> flags the risks that come from relying on artificial intelligence to clean the web. And <a href="https://twitter.com/lawlkat?lang=en">Kat Lo</a> explains why this work is impossible to get exactly right.</p>
<p>Some of the content in this episode is sensitive and may be difficult to hear for some listeners.</p>

        <p>What, if anything, should be banned from online media? And who should review violent and explicit content, in order to decide if it’s okay for the public? Thousands of people around the world are working long, difficult hours as content moderators in support of sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. They are guided by complex and shifting guidelines, and their work can sometimes lead to psychological trauma. But the practice of content moderation also raises questions about censorship and free expression online.</p>
<p>In this IRL episode, host <a href="https://twitter.com/manoushz/">Manoush Zomorodi</a> talks with a forensic investigator who compares the work she does solving disturbing crimes with the work done by content moderators. We hear the stories of content moderators working in the Philippines, as told by the directors of a new documentary called <a href="http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/films/the-cleaners/">The Cleaners</a>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/silverellen">Ellen Silver</a> from Facebook joins us to outline Facebook's content moderation policies. <a href="https://www.kalevleetaru.com/">Kalev Leetaru</a> flags the risks that come from relying on artificial intelligence to clean the web. And <a href="https://twitter.com/lawlkat?lang=en">Kat Lo</a> explains why this work is impossible to get exactly right.</p>
<p>Some of the content in this episode is sensitive and may be difficult to hear for some listeners.</p>

      <title>TL;DR</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>TL;DR: We have access to more things to read than ever before. Too much, in fact. Our reading habits have shifted. We skim a lot. We look for full stories baked into headlines. Our eyes bounce around from one article to the next, and we try and fail to manage how many things we read at once. Some of us can no longer concentrate on a book—no matter how good it might be. Reading has changed. And we’re changing alongside it.</p>

      <title>Your Password is the Worst</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Look, we agree with you: passwords are the worst. But you know what else is the worst? Someone hacking your account, or big security breaches that expose your email, your credit card information, your government-issued identification number, and more. We should hold companies accountable for better security, but we also need to hold ourselves accountable for having good password hygiene. So let's tackle this once and for all. Hear from Buzzfeed's <a href="https://twitter.com/mat">Mat Honan</a>, who endured a brutal hack a few years ago when hackers exploited password-recovery tools; <a href="https://twitter.com/ctrlzee?lang=en">Mark Wilson</a> from Fast Company, who wants to ban passwords altogether (though admits it's not the best idea); <a href="https://twitter.com/modMasha?lang=en">Masha Sedova</a> of Elevate Security who says that, yes, security companies have failed us – but we have to use passwords anyway; and <a href="https://twitter.com/mattdavey?lang=en">Matt Davey</a> of <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, who offers a solution that Mozilla can get behind: use a password manager. A simple, game-changing tool that will help you take back control of your accounts, and secure yourself as best as you can.</p>
<p>IRL is an original podcast from <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. For more on the series go to <a href="https://irlpodcast.org/">irlpodcast.org</a></p>
<p>Your passwords protect more than your accounts. They protect every bit of personal information that resides in them. And hackers rely on bad habits, like using the same password everywhere or using common phrases (p@ssw0rd, anyone?), so that if they hack one account, they can hack many.</p>
<p>Password managers like <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>, <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/">Dashlane</a>, and <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> generate strong, unique passwords. They also store passwords securely and fill them into websites for you.</p>
<p>IRL listeners can sign up to 1Password and get their first three months for free. Just visit <a href="https://1password.com/promo/IRL/">1password.com/promo/IRL</a> and give it a try.</p>
<p>And, if you use Firefox on your iPhone, try out <a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/firefox-lockbox/">Firefox Lockbox</a>. It securely gives you access to all the logins you've saved to Firefox, in a secure app on your phone.</p>
<p>As we mention in this episode of IRL, Gabriela Ivens cataloged hundreds of secret recipes that were leaked during data breaches. Firefox teamed up with her to show the personal impact a security breach can have on someone. As a bonus, we let you in on those precious recipes to drive the point home.

Someone hacking your account, or big security breaches that expose your email, your credit card information, your government-issued identification number, and more. We should hold companies accountable for better security, but we also need to hold ourselves accountable for having good password hygiene. So let's tackle this once and for all. Hear from Buzzfeed's Mat Honan, who endured a brutal hack a few years ago when hackers exploited password-recovery tools; Mark Wilson from Fast Company, who wants to ban passwords altogether (though admits it's not the best idea); Masha Sedova of Elevate Security who says that, yes, security companies have failed us – but we have to use passwords anyway; and Matt Davey of 1Password, who offers a solution that Mozilla can get behind: use a password manager. A simple, game-changing tool that will help you take back control of your accounts, and secure yourself as best as you can.

In conversation with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/sheera-frenkel">The New York Times’ Sheera Frenkel</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/noUpside">Data For Democracy Policy Lead and Mozilla Fellow Renee DiResta</a>, and <a href="http://jestincoler.com/">DisInfoMedia founder Jestin Coler</a>, we navigate the age of disinformation. It’s the season finale of IRL, recorded live in San Francisco on March 18th, 2018.</p>

      <title>Introducing IRL: Because Online Life is Real Life</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Our online life is real life. We walk, talk, work, LOL and even love on the Internet – but we don’t always treat it like real life. Host <a href="https://twitter.com/veronica">Veronica Belmont</a> explores this disconnect with stories from the wilds of the Web – and gets to the bottom of online issues that affect us all. Whether it’s privacy breaches, closed platforms, hacking, fake news, or cyber bullying, we the people have the power to change the course of the Internet, keeping it healthy, weird, and wonderful for everyone. IRL is an original podcast from <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>.</p>
